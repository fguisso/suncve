The part of trunk which verifies whether a user has a real email address on signup used a rfc-822 library which executes a shell command to validate the email domain MX records validity. It works via an DNS MX. This lookup could be manipulated to also execute a command on the trunk server, effectively giving root access to the server and the infrastructure. This issue was patched server-side with commit 001cc3a430e75a16307f5fd6cdff1363ad2f40f3 in September 2023. This RCE triggered a full user-session reset, as an attacker could have used this method to write to any Podspec in trunk."], "published": "2024-07-01T21:15:03.797", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["CocoaPods"], "productName": ["CocoaPods"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/security/advisories/GHSA-x2x4-g675-qg7c"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cocoapods", "dependency-manager", "ios", "mac", "objective-c", "package-manager", "swift"], "langs": {"Ruby": 2435979, "Objective-C": 46602, "Swift": 22680, "C": 136, "M": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189714?v=4", "stargazers": 14688, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/ReeFSpeK/CocoaPods-RCE_CVE-2024-38366", "https://github.com/ReeFSpeK/CocoaPods-RCE_CVE-2024-38366"]}
