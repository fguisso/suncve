This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy and strip, to crash."], "published": "2017-05-01T18:59:00.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
