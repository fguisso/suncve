The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Typeâ€™s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2 and 3.29.4. As a workaround, implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using `@fastify/csrf'."], "published": "2022-11-22T20:15:11.110", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fastify"], "productName": ["fastify"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjj-p79j-c9hh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/62dde76f1f7aca76e38625fe8d983761f26e6fc9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["nodejs", "performance", "speed", "webframework"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1614024, "TypeScript": 156684, "Shell": 911}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24939410?v=4", "stargazers": 33361, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
