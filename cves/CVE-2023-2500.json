This allows authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code."], "published": "2023-05-25T00:15:09.230", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Granth"], "productName": ["Go Pricing - WordPress Responsive Pricing Tables"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
