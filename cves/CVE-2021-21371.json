It published in pypi as \"tenable-jira-cloud\". In tenable-jira-cloud before version 1.1.21, it is possible to run arbitrary commands through the yaml.load() method. This could allow an attacker with local access to the host to run arbitrary code by running the application with a specially crafted YAML configuration file. This is fixed in version 1.1.21 by using yaml.safe_load() instead of yaml.load()."], "published": "2021-03-10T22:15:12.307", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tenable"], "productName": ["integration-jira-cloud"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tenable/integration-jira-cloud/security/advisories/GHSA-8278-88vv-x98r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tenable/integration-jira-cloud/commit/f8c2095fd529e664e7fa25403a0a4a85bb3907d0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tenable/integration-jira-cloud/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 149945, "Dockerfile": 168}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2379954?v=4", "stargazers": 70, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
