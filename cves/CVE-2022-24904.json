Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround."], "published": "2022-05-20T14:15:09.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["argoproj"], "productName": ["argo-cd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-6gcg-hp2x-q54h"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["argo", "argo-cd", "cd", "ci-cd", "cicd", "continuous-delivery", "continuous-deployment", "devops", "docker", "gitops", "hacktoberfest", "helm", "jsonnet", "kubernetes", "kustomize", "pipeline"], "langs": {"Go": 6874433, "TypeScript": 1314767, "Lua": 210938, "SCSS": 93949, "Shell": 58360, "Makefile": 25024, "Dockerfile": 15364, "Procfile": 10040, "JavaScript": 5975, "CSS": 2209, "Mustache": 1066, "HTML": 895}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30269780?v=4", "stargazers": 19120, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
