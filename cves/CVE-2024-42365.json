Prior to asterisk versions 18.24.2, 20.9.2, and 21.4.2 and certified-asterisk versions 18.9-cert11 and 20.7-cert2, an AMI user with `write=originate` may change all configuration files in the `/etc/asterisk/` directory. This occurs because they are able to curl remote files and write them to disk, but are also able to append to existing files using the `FILE` function inside the `SET` application. This issue may result in privilege escalation, remote code execution and/or blind server-side request forgery with arbitrary protocol. Asterisk versions 18.24.2, 20.9.2, and 21.4.2 and certified-asterisk versions 18.9-cert11 and 20.7-cert2 contain a fix for this issue."], "published": "2024-08-08T17:15:19.340", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["asterisk"], "productName": ["asterisk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-c4cg-9275-6w44"], "commits": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/42a2f4ccfa2c7062a15063e765916b3332e34cc4", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/7a0090325bfa9d778a39ae5f7d0a98109e4651c8", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/b4063bf756272254b160b6d1bd6e9a3f8e16cc71", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/bbe68db10ab8a80c29db383e4dfe14f6eafaf993", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/faddd99f2b9408b524e5eb8a01589fe1fa282df2"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-c4cg-9275-6w44", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asterisk", "c", "pbx", "sip", "voip"], "langs": {"C": 36729260, "Python": 359115, "Shell": 261117, "M4": 191704, "Makefile": 136302, "Perl": 111005, "Yacc": 64828, "Mustache": 26327, "Lex": 26043, "XSLT": 15366, "Vim Script": 11793, "HTML": 11310, "Roff": 10448, "JavaScript": 7906, "Tcl": 4198, "PHP": 2106, "Mako": 1730, "CSS": 1031, "Awk": 642}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2914369?v=4", "stargazers": 2482, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
