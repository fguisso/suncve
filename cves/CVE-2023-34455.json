Due to use of an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1.\n\nThe code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn’t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.\n\nIn the case that the `compressed` variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn’t test the legality of the `chunkSize` variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue."], "published": "2023-06-15T18:15:09.347", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["xerial"], "productName": ["snappy-java"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-qcwq-55hx-v3vh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-qcwq-55hx-v3vh", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 319032, "C++": 227887, "Shell": 94403, "Makefile": 9706, "Scala": 6548, "C": 5658, "CSS": 1554, "CMake": 525}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57538?v=4", "stargazers": 1053, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
