In affected versions authenticated attackers posing as functionaries (i.e., within a trusted set of users for a layout) are able to create attestations that may bypass DISALLOW rules in the same layout. An attacker with access to trusted private keys, may issue an attestation that contains a disallowed artifact by including path traversal semantics (e.g., foo vs dir/../foo). Exploiting this vulnerability is dependent on the specific policy applied. The problem has been fixed in version 0.3.0."], "published": "2021-09-21T21:15:07.203", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["in-toto"], "productName": ["in-toto-golang"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/security/advisories/GHSA-vrxp-mg9f-hwf3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/commit/f2c57d1e0f15e3ffbeac531829c696b72ecc4290"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["in-toto", "security", "software-supply-chain"], "langs": {"Go": 407844, "Makefile": 7391, "Shell": 2214, "Dockerfile": 407}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22891761?v=4", "stargazers": 136, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
