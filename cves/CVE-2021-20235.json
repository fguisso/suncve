A remote, unauthenticated attacker who sends a crafted request to the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact of this flaw is to application availability, data integrity, and confidentiality."], "published": "2021-04-01T14:15:13.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["zeromq"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["concurrency", "libzmq", "messaging", "network", "networking", "pubsub", "pushpull", "stream", "zeromq", "zmq", "zmtp"], "langs": {"C++": 2343349, "M4": 137539, "CMake": 92636, "Shell": 68137, "Makefile": 62492, "C": 37408, "Python": 31282, "Batchfile": 4428, "Dockerfile": 2584}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109777?v=4", "stargazers": 10070, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
