An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run malicious code remotely to take control of the user’s system.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to invoke MSXML through a web browser. However, an attacker would have no way to force a user to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would typically have to convince a user to either click a link in an email message or instant message that would then take the user to the website. When Internet Explorer parses the XML content, an attacker could run malicious code remotely to take control of the user’s system.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the MSXML parser processes user input.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:13.860", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows Server, version 1803  (Server Core Installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1507", "Windows 10 Version 1703", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012", "Windows 7 Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Systems Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2012 R2", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1", "Windows 7", "Windows 8.1", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2008  Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2016"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
