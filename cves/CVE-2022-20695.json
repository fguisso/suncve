An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and log in to the device as an administrator. The attacker could obtain privileges that are the same level as an administrative user but it depends on the crafted credentials. Note: This vulnerability exists because of a non-default device configuration that must be present for it to be exploitable.
