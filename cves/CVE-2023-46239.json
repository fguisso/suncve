Starting in version 0.37.0 and prior to version 0.37.3, by serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number space. An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few packets. Version 0.37.3 contains a patch. Versions before 0.37.0 are not affected."], "published": "2023-10-31T16:15:09.543", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["quic-go"], "productName": ["quic-go"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-3q6m-v84f-6p9h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/b6a4725b60f1fe04e8f1ddcc3114e290fcea1617"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["go", "golang", "http3", "protocol", "quic", "quic-client", "quic-server"], "langs": {"Go": 2529028, "Shell": 3386, "Dockerfile": 1884}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117172986?v=4", "stargazers": 10551, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
