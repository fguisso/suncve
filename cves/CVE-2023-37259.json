The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature."], "published": "2023-07-18T17:15:11.490", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-react-sdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-c9vx-2g7w-rp65"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/commit/22fcd34c606f32129ebc967fc21f24fb708a98b8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "matrix", "matrix-chat", "matrix-sdk"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 13326839, "CSS": 1012051, "JavaScript": 32699, "Shell": 6707, "Python": 5019, "HTML": 2809, "Dockerfile": 350}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 1106, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
