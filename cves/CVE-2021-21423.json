Users of projen's `NodeProject` project type (including any project type derived from it) include a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` workflow that may allow any GitHub user to trigger execution of un-trusted code in the context of the \"main\" repository (as opposed to that of a fork). In some situations, such untrusted code may potentially be able to commit to the \"main\" repository. The rebuild-bot workflow is triggered by comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-build of the projen project, and updating the pull request with the updated files. This workflow is triggered by an `issue_comment` event, and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast with workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, which always execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository from which the pull-request is made). Repositories that do not have branch protection configured on their default branch (typically `main` or `master`) could possibly allow an untrusted user to gain access to secrets configured on the repository (such as NPM tokens, etc). Branch protection prohibits this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not be able to modify the contents of a protected branch and affected workflows must be defined on the default branch."], "published": "2021-04-06T19:15:14.787", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["projen"], "productName": ["projen"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/projen/projen/security/advisories/GHSA-gg2g-m5wc-vccq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/projen/projen/commit/36030c6a4b1acd0054673322612e7c70e9446643"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/projen/projen/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aws-cdk", "cdk", "constructs", "generator", "hacktoberfest", "jsii", "repository-management", "repository-tools", "scaffolding", "templates", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1870355, "JavaScript": 25784, "CSS": 1727, "HTML": 1721, "Shell": 743}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73786311?v=4", "stargazers": 2781, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
