In affected versions `ssl::select_next_proto` can return a slice pointing into the `server` argument's buffer but with a lifetime bound to the `client` argument. In situations where the `sever` buffer's lifetime is shorter than the `client` buffer's, this can cause a use after free. This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to the client. The crate`openssl` version 0.10.70 fixes the signature of `ssl::select_next_proto` to properly constrain the output buffer's lifetime to that of both input buffers. Users are advised to upgrade. In standard usage of `ssl::select_next_proto` in the callback passed to `SslContextBuilder::set_alpn_select_callback`, code is only affected if the `server` buffer is constructed *within* the callback."], "published": "2025-02-03T18:15:43.077", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sfackler"], "productName": ["rust-openssl"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/security/advisories/GHSA-rpmj-rpgj-qmpm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 1597135, "C": 2679}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1455697?v=4", "stargazers": 1454, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
