This happens for every non-array argument passed. **Note:** pg-native is a mere binding to npm's libpq library, which in turn has the addons and bindings to the actual C libpq library. This means that problems found in pg-native may transitively impact npm's libpq."], "published": "2022-06-17T20:15:10.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a", "n/a"], "productName": ["pg-native", "libpq"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
