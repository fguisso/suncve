In Asterisk versions 18.20.0 and prior, 20.5.0 and prior, and 21.0.0; as well as ceritifed-asterisk 18.9-cert5 and prior, the 'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed the available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This is not externally exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used the vulnerability does not occur. A patch is available at commit a1ca0268254374b515fa5992f01340f7717113fa."], "published": "2023-12-14T20:15:52.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["asterisk"], "productName": ["asterisk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-98rc-4j27-74hh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/a1ca0268254374b515fa5992f01340f7717113fa"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asterisk", "c", "pbx", "sip", "voip"], "langs": {"C": 36729260, "Python": 359115, "Shell": 261117, "M4": 191704, "Makefile": 136302, "Perl": 111005, "Yacc": 64828, "Mustache": 26327, "Lex": 26043, "XSLT": 15366, "Vim Script": 11793, "HTML": 11310, "Roff": 10448, "JavaScript": 7906, "Tcl": 4198, "PHP": 2106, "Mako": 1730, "CSS": 1031, "Awk": 642}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2914369?v=4", "stargazers": 2482, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
