A configuration injection happens when user input is considered by the application in an unsanitized format and can reach the configuration file. A malicious user may craft a special payload that may lead to a command injection. The impact of a configuration injection may vary. Under some conditions, it may lead to command injection if there is for instance shell code execution from the configuration file values. This vulnerability does not currently have a fix.\n"], "published": "2023-06-23T22:15:08.987", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tanghaibao"], "productName": ["jcvi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/security/advisories/GHSA-x49m-3cw7-gq5q"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/security/advisories/GHSA-x49m-3cw7-gq5q", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["allmaps", "assembly", "bioinformatics", "blast", "comparative-genomics", "genetic-maps", "genome-sequencing", "genomics", "sequence-alignments", "synteny", "variant-calling"], "langs": {"Python": 2606386, "Cython": 10465, "Dockerfile": 1144, "Makefile": 445}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106987?v=4", "stargazers": 810, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
