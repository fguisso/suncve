The gatsby-source-wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during build-time. Users who are not initializing basic authentication credentials in the gatsby-config.js are not affected. A patch has been introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables specified in the `auth: { }` section. Users that depend on this functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-source-wordpress, run `gatsby clean` followed by a `gatsby build`. One may manually edit the app.js file post-build as a workaround."], "published": "2021-07-15T19:15:07.920", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gatsbyjs"], "productName": ["gatsby"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/security/advisories/GHSA-rqjw-p5vr-c695"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog", "compiler", "gatsby", "graphql", "react", "static-site-generator", "web-app"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 5322406, "TypeScript": 3485100, "CSS": 94587, "HTML": 62235, "MDX": 40139, "Shell": 11157, "Dockerfile": 2751, "PHP": 2010, "EJS": 461, "Python": 281, "Less": 218, "SCSS": 218, "Stylus": 206}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12551863?v=4", "stargazers": 55799, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
