Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed."], "published": "2024-09-26T20:15:07.310", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["badges"], "productName": ["shields"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/badges/shields/security/advisories/GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445"], "commits": ["https://github.com/badges/shields/commit/ec1b6c8daccda075403c1688ac02603f7aaa50b2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/badges/shields/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["badge", "badge-maker", "github", "hacktoberfest", "metadata", "status", "svg"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 2669023, "CSS": 1569, "Dockerfile": 958, "HTML": 866, "TypeScript": 635, "Procfile": 31}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6254238?v=4", "stargazers": 24601, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
