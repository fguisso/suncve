The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input on the command-line interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with read-only privileges via the CLI of an affected device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges."], "published": "2019-08-21T19:15:14.637", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Software (UCSE) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
