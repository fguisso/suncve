The malformed investigation prevents the generation and rendering of the Investigations manager until it is deleted.<br>The vulnerability requires an authenticated session and access to create an Investigation. It only affects the availability of the Investigations manager, but without the manager, the Investigations functionality becomes unusable for most users."], "published": "2024-01-09T17:15:12.523", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Splunk"], "productName": ["Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
