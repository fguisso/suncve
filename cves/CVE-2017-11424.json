Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft JWTs from scratch."], "published": "2017-08-24T16:29:00.197", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
