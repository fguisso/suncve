Versions prior to 2.4.3 (07 March 2023) are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery. This can lead to an attacker gaining access to a Budibase AWS secret key. Users of Budibase cloud need to take no action. Self-host users who run Budibase on the public internet and are using a cloud provider that allows HTTP access to metadata information should ensure that when they deploy Budibase live, their internal metadata endpoint is not exposed."], "published": "2023-04-06T17:15:10.620", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Budibase"], "productName": ["budibase"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/security/advisories/GHSA-9xg2-9mcv-985p"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/security/advisories/GHSA-9xg2-9mcv-985p", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai-app-builder", "ai-applications", "crud-app", "crud-application", "data-application", "data-apps", "internal-tools", "it-workflows", "low-code", "low-code-no-code", "low-code-platform", "no-code", "no-code-platform", "open-source", "rest-api-framework", "sql-gui", "workflow-apps", "workflow-automation", "workflow-engine"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 4890399, "Svelte": 3425602, "JavaScript": 589581, "Shell": 55148, "Handlebars": 20901, "Dockerfile": 16295, "CSS": 10065, "HTML": 4965, "mdsvex": 2948, "Smarty": 2199, "TSQL": 1595}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45009727?v=4", "stargazers": 23801, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
