It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions. If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability."], "published": "2019-12-07T00:15:11.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["commenthol"], "productName": ["serialize-to-js"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/commenthol/serialize-to-js/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjq-93xj-3f3f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/commenthol/serialize-to-js/commit/181d7d583ae5293cd47cc99b14ad13352875f3e3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/commenthol/serialize-to-js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "serialize-objects"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 22030, "Makefile": 181}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2604482?v=4", "stargazers": 26, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
