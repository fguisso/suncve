Started with version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resource which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request implies that one is already in a privileged position. This issue was fixed in version 22.10.0rc1. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-10-26T20:15:10.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["twisted"], "productName": ["twisted"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-vg46-2rrj-3647"], "commits": ["https://github.com/twisted/twisted/commit/f2f5e81c03f14e253e85fe457e646130780db40b", "https://github.com/twisted/twisted/commit/f49041bb67792506d85aeda9cf6157e92f8048f4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/twisted/twisted/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["async", "async-python", "dns", "event-driven", "http", "imap", "irc", "network", "python", "smtp", "ssl", "tls", "twisted", "xmpp"], "langs": {"Python": 12647493, "GAP": 18052, "Batchfile": 3472, "Shell": 3244, "JavaScript": 752, "HTML": 270, "Gherkin": 140}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716546?v=4", "stargazers": 5730, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
