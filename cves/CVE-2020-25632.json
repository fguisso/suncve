The rmmod implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."], "published": "2021-03-03T17:15:11.660", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["grub2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/pauljrowland/BootHoleFix", "https://github.com/pauljrowland/BootHoleFix"]}
