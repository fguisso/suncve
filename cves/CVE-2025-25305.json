Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past, `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0, this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant, in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True`, which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.1.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2025-02-18T19:15:29.083", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["home-assistant"], "productName": ["core"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-m3pm-rpgg-5wj6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-m3pm-rpgg-5wj6", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/home-assistant/core/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asyncio", "hacktoberfest", "home-automation", "internet-of-things", "iot", "mqtt", "python", "raspberry-pi"], "langs": {"Python": 83168758, "Shell": 6502, "Dockerfile": 1906, "PLSQL": 840, "JavaScript": 592, "Jinja": 182}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13844975?v=4", "stargazers": 77890, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
