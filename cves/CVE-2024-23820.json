In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a call to `ListObjects` may not  release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an `out of memory` error and terminate. Version 1.4.3 contains a patch for this issue."], "published": "2024-01-26T17:15:13.287", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["openfga"], "productName": ["openfga"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-rxpw-85vw-fx87"], "commits": ["https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/908ac85c8b7769c8042cca31886df8db01976c39"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["abac", "authorization", "entitlements", "fga", "fine-grained-access-control", "fine-grained-authorization", "go", "golang", "hacktoberfest", "openfga", "pbac", "permissions", "rbac", "rebac", "security", "zanzibar"], "langs": {"Go": 3178271, "Makefile": 7519, "Dockerfile": 1277, "HTML": 379}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103602580?v=4", "stargazers": 3434, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
