Versions prior to 1.1.9 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing elevation to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases that use the aiven-extras package. The vulnerability leverages missing schema qualifiers on privileged functions called by the aiven-extras extension. A low privileged user can create objects that collide with existing function names, which will then be executed instead. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to acquire `superuser` privileges, which would allow full, unrestricted access to all data and database functions. And could lead to arbitrary code execution or data access on the underlying host as the `postgres` user. The issue has been patched as of version 1.1.9."], "published": "2023-05-12T19:15:08.953", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aiven"], "productName": ["aiven-extras"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/security/advisories/GHSA-7r4w-fw4h-67gp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/commit/8682ae01bec0791708bf25791786d776e2fb0250"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aiven", "postgresql"], "langs": {"PLpgSQL": 59814, "C": 5960, "Makefile": 2045, "Shell": 254}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14290521?v=4", "stargazers": 17, "language": "PLpgSQL"}}, "pocList": []}
