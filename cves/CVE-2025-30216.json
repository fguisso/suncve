In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`). When processing the Secondary Header Length of a TM protocol packet, if the Secondary Header Length exceeds the packet's total length, a heap overflow is triggered during the memcpy operation that copies packet data into the dynamically allocated buffer `p_new_dec_frame`. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability. A patch is available at commit 810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f."], "published": "2025-03-25T20:15:22.567", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nasa"], "productName": ["CryptoLib"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-v3jc-5j74-hcjv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-v3jc-5j74-hcjv", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ccsds", "cfs", "communications", "data-link", "ground-station", "sdls-ep", "space-communications", "space-data-link-security-protocol", "space-network", "spack-data-link"], "langs": {"C": 2002164, "C++": 58820, "CMake": 24681, "Python": 15181, "Shell": 7065, "Dockerfile": 2622, "Makefile": 898}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848102?v=4", "stargazers": 100, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/oliviaisntcringe/CVE-2025-30216-PoC", "https://github.com/oliviaisntcringe/CVE-2025-30216-PoC"]}
