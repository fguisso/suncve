The weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. After upgrading MyBB to 1.8.24, make sure to update the version attribute in the `codebuttons` template for non-default themes to serve the latest version of the patched `jscripts/bbcodes_sceditor.js` file."], "published": "2020-08-10T22:15:14.223", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MyBB"], "productName": ["MyBB"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-37h7-vfv6-f8rj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/37ad29dcd25489a37bdd89ebac761f22492558b0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["forum", "mybb", "mysql", "php", "postgresql", "sqlite"], "langs": {"PHP": 5604699, "JavaScript": 144087, "CSS": 68455, "HTML": 14057}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328641?v=4", "stargazers": 1136, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
