This issue arises due to insufficient validation of input, which can be exploited to bypass method restrictions and execute unauthorized code. The vulnerability is a bypass of the previously addressed CVE-2023-39662, demonstrated through a proof of concept that creates a file on the system by exploiting the flaw."], "published": "2024-04-10T17:15:56.213", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["run-llama"], "productName": ["run-llama/llama_index"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/commit/5fbcb5a8b9f20f81b791c7fc8849e352613ab475"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["agents", "application", "data", "fine-tuning", "framework", "llamaindex", "llm", "multi-agents", "rag", "vector-database"], "langs": {"Python": 12955767, "Jupyter Notebook": 11305578, "Makefile": 430053, "JavaScript": 85982, "Starlark": 78265, "Tree-sitter Query": 17376, "Dockerfile": 5734, "Shell": 4557}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130722866?v=4", "stargazers": 40717, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
