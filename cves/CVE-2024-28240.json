A vulnerability that only affects GLPI-Agent installed on windows via MSI packaging can allow a local user to cause denial of agent service by replacing GLPI server url with a wrong url or disabling the service. Additionally, in the case the Deploy task is installed, a local malicious user can trigger privilege escalation configuring a malicious server providing its own deploy task payload. GLPI-Agent 1.7.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, edit GLPI-Agent related key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall` and add `SystemComponent` DWORD value setting it to `1` to hide GLPI-Agent from installed applications."], "published": "2024-04-25T17:15:49.010", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["glpi-project"], "productName": ["glpi-agent"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-hx3x-mmqg-h3jp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent/commit/41bbb1169e899bd15350a9e2fdbf9269a3b7a14f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["agent", "glpi", "glpi-agent", "inventory", "inventory-agent"], "langs": {"Perl": 5772266, "Roff": 823520, "Smarty": 189031, "Shell": 130960, "Rich Text Format": 37144, "VBScript": 23207, "CSS": 18543, "Go": 7533, "C++": 3933, "Makefile": 764, "C": 737}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13361707?v=4", "stargazers": 283, "language": "Perl"}}, "pocList": []}
