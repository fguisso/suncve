A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption."], "published": "2017-05-24T15:29:00.277", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/f015fbdd95f76438cd86366467bb2b39870dd7c6", "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/b4bf968ad52afe14e60a2dc8a95d3555c543353a"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "regexp", "regular-expression"], "langs": {"C": 2586514, "Shell": 64509, "Python": 49364, "HTML": 17279, "CMake": 12267, "Makefile": 8691, "M4": 2689, "C++": 1193, "Batchfile": 464}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/884169?v=4", "stargazers": 2407, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
