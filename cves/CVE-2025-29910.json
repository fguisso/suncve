A memory leak vulnerability was identified in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance over time, particularly in long-running processes or systems processing large volumes of data. The vulnerability is present in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function within `crypto_tc.c`. The function allocates memory using `malloc` without ensuring the allocated memory is always freed. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, reduced system performance, and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) in environments where CryptoLib is used in long-running processes or with large volumes of data. Any system using CryptoLib, especially those handling high-throughput or continuous data streams, could be impacted. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available."], "published": "2025-03-17T22:15:14.810", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nasa"], "productName": ["CryptoLib"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-p38w-p2r8-g6g5"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-p38w-p2r8-g6g5", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ccsds", "cfs", "communications", "data-link", "ground-station", "sdls-ep", "space-communications", "space-data-link-security-protocol", "space-network", "spack-data-link"], "langs": {"C": 2002164, "C++": 58820, "CMake": 24681, "Python": 15181, "Shell": 7065, "Dockerfile": 2622, "Makefile": 898}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848102?v=4", "stargazers": 100, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
