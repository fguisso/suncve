Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, a malformed SIP message containing a large _Content-Length_ value and a specially crafted Request-URI causes a segmentation fault in OpenSIPS. This issue occurs when a large amount of shared memory using the `-m` flag was allocated to OpenSIPS, such as 10 GB of RAM. On the test system, this issue occurred when shared memory was set to `2362` or higher. This issue is fixed in versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6. The only workaround is to guarantee that the Content-Length value of input messages is never larger than `2147483647`."], "published": "2023-03-15T23:15:09.627", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenSIPS"], "productName": ["opensips"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-c6j5-f4h4-2xrq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/7cab422e2fc648f910abba34f3f0dbb3ae171ff5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 17218284, "Makefile": 128744, "Yacc": 81144, "Perl": 72729, "Python": 64356, "C++": 62693, "Shell": 36120, "M4": 32463, "XS": 31933, "Lex": 31126, "PHP": 16028, "Roff": 10751, "Vim Script": 5424, "GDB": 2914, "CMake": 461}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3853758?v=4", "stargazers": 1336, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
