The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library, when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions, can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication, preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently, CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session, fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing, and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: ['passport', 'session'])` to clear all the session attributes by default, preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`."], "published": "2023-04-21T23:15:20.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fastify"], "productName": ["fastify-passport"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/security/advisories/GHSA-2ccf-ffrj-m4qw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/commit/07c90feab9cba0dd4779e47cfb0717a7e2f01d3d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["authentication", "fastify", "fastify-plugin", "passport"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 128835, "JavaScript": 344}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24939410?v=4", "stargazers": 274, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
