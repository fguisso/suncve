In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file` in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers can access sensitive system directories such as `/etc`, potentially exposing critical configuration files and increasing the risk of further attacks. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available."], "published": "2024-10-24T22:15:04.287", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["IceWhaleTech"], "productName": ["ZimaOS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-mwpw-fhrm-728x"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-mwpw-fhrm-728x", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Shell": 1021}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91336243?v=4", "stargazers": 1227, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
