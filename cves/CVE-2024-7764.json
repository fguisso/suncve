The vulnerability occurs when the `generate_sql` function calls `extract_sql` with the LLM response. An attacker can include a semi-colon between a search data field and their own command, causing the `extract_sql` function to remove all LLM generated SQL and execute the attacker's command if it passes the `is_sql_valid` function. This allows the execution of user-defined SQL beyond the expected boundaries, notably the trained schema."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:36.717", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vanna-ai"], "productName": ["vanna-ai/vanna"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
