This exploit allows Discord users with a high privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it is possible to perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high privileges in. This exploit has been fixed in version 3.4.1. As a workaround, unloading the Mod module with unload mod or, disabling the massban command with command disable global massban can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to 3.4.1 to completely patch this issue."], "published": "2020-10-28T17:15:12.420", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cog-Creators"], "productName": ["Red-DiscordBot"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/security/advisories/GHSA-mp9m-g7qj-6vqr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/commit/726bfd38adfdfaef760412a68e01447b470f438b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bot", "chatbot", "discord", "discord-bot", "fun", "hacktoberfest", "moderation", "modular", "music", "python", "trivia"], "langs": {"Python": 2828309, "PLpgSQL": 25564, "PowerShell": 2738, "Makefile": 1730, "Batchfile": 1281, "HTML": 454}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23690422?v=4", "stargazers": 5026, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
