This is because FTP client code in HPL/SQL does not verify the destination location of the downloaded file. This does not affect hive cli user and hiveserver2 user as hplsql is a separate command line script and needs to be invoked differently."], "published": "2018-04-05T13:29:01.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Hive"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
