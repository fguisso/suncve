In versions 1.12.4 and prior, the `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node allows an improperly authenticated attacker to remotely execute code on nodes within the network. The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node 1.12.5 has been updated to properly authenticate pool-upgrade transactions before any processing is performed by the request handler. The transactions are further sanitized to prevent remote code execution. As a workaround, endorsers should not create DIDs for untrusted users. A vulnerable ledger should configure `auth_rules` to prevent new DIDs from being written to the ledger until the network can be upgraded."], "published": "2022-09-06T17:15:08.220", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["hyperledger"], "productName": ["indy-node"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/security/advisories/GHSA-r6v9-p59m-gj2p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/commit/fe507474f77084faef4539101e2bbb4d508a97f5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["indy"], "langs": {"Python": 2488328, "Shell": 133684, "Dockerfile": 10924, "Batchfile": 3329, "Makefile": 1650, "Jinja": 1587}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7657900?v=4", "stargazers": 694, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
