The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater. A possible workaround is provided in the linked advisory."], "published": "2020-10-05T19:15:15.103", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["shrinerb"], "productName": ["shrine"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine/security/advisories/GHSA-5jjv-x4fq-qjwp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine/commit/1b27090ce31543bf39f186c20ea47c8250fca2f0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["attachment", "background-jobs", "direct-upload", "file-upload", "filesystem", "metadata", "orm", "rack", "ruby", "s3", "storage"], "langs": {"Ruby": 755398, "JavaScript": 7298, "CSS": 445, "Shell": 176, "Dockerfile": 148}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37269986?v=4", "stargazers": 3204, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
