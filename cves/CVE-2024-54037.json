By manipulating a DOM element through a crafted URL or user input, the high-privileged attacker can inject malicious scripts that run when the page is rendered. This type of attack requires user interaction, as the victim would need to visit a malicious link or input data into a compromised form. A successful attacker can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact as high."], "published": "2024-12-10T21:15:21.080", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Adobe"], "productName": ["Adobe Connect"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
