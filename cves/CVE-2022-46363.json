These attributes are not supposed to be used together, and so the vulnerability can only arise if the CXF service is misconfigured."], "published": "2022-12-13T15:15:11.677", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache CXF"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
