This vulnerability can be exploited in two ways. If an attacker sends a malicious link to a computer that is on the same domain as the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint server and a user clicks the link, the attacker could impersonate the legitimate user and send requests to the affected product.  Additionally, if an attacker sends an untrusted link to a computer that is not on the same domain as the server and a user opens the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint website, enters credentials for the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint server, and clicks on the malicious link a cross site request forgery attack would be successful as well.\n\n"], "published": "2023-05-11T19:15:09.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Rockwell Automation"], "productName": ["FactoryTalk Vantagepoint"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
