Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`."], "published": "2022-05-05T23:15:09.083", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mozilla"], "productName": ["hawk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/security/advisories/GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["inactive", "unmaintained"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 139483}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131524?v=4", "stargazers": 1909, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
