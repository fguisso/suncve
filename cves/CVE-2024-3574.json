This vulnerability arises from the failure to remove the Authorization header when redirecting across domains. The exposure of the Authorization header to unauthorized actors could potentially allow for account hijacking."], "published": "2024-04-16T00:15:12.750", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["scrapy"], "productName": ["scrapy/scrapy"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/commit/5bcb8fd5019c72d05c4a96da78a7fcb6ecb55b75"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["crawler", "crawling", "framework", "hacktoberfest", "python", "scraping", "web-scraping", "web-scraping-python"], "langs": {"Python": 2353613, "HTML": 3290, "Roff": 2010, "Shell": 252}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/733635?v=4", "stargazers": 54786, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
