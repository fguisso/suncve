Among these cogs is the Defender cog, a tool for Discord server moderation. A vulnerability in the Defender cog prior to version 1.10.0 allows users with admin privileges to issue commands as other users who share the same server. If a bot owner shares the same server as the attacker, it is possible for the attacker to issue bot-owner restricted commands. The issue has been patched in version 1.10.0. One may unload the Defender cog as a workaround."], "published": "2022-02-15T16:15:09.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Twentysix26"], "productName": ["x26-Cogs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/security/advisories/GHSA-cfh8-v56j-5757"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/commit/72dd9323cb4c90f3a5accac7087605375d178246"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 433693}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6267772?v=4", "stargazers": 40, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
