So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their \nown server. Still, a situation can happen where an admin not \nknowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into \nwriting the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Convict: before 6.2.4."], "published": "2024-11-26T12:15:17.390", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Mozilla"], "productName": ["Convict"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict/security/advisories/GHSA-4jrm-c32x-w4jf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["config", "configuration", "configuration-management", "env", "environment-variables", "javascript", "json", "json-files", "node", "nodejs", "schema", "validation"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 78191, "Shell": 694}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131524?v=4", "stargazers": 2360, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
