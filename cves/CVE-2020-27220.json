The missing check involves verifying that the command target device is configured giving permission for the gateway device to act on its behalf. This means an authenticated device of a certain tenant, notably also a non-gateway device acting like a gateway, may receive command & control messages targeted at a different device of the same tenant without corresponding permissions getting checked."], "published": "2021-01-14T23:15:13.040", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["The Eclipse Foundation"], "productName": ["Eclipse Hono"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
