This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."], "published": "2025-03-07T09:15:14.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Chimpstudio"], "productName": ["CS Framework"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
