Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources."], "published": "2022-01-14T17:15:13.270", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["markedjs"], "productName": ["marked"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-5v2h-r2cx-5xgj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/8f806573a3f6c6b7a39b8cdb66ab5ebb8d55a5f5"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-5v2h-r2cx-5xgj", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["commonmark", "compiler", "gfm", "hacktoberfest", "markdown", "parser"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 110564, "JavaScript": 110531, "HTML": 94597}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19886934?v=4", "stargazers": 34294, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
