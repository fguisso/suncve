This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files (not including PHP files) on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This can be paired with a registration endpoint for unauthenticated users to exploit the issue."], "published": "2024-09-13T15:15:16.767", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["inspireui"], "productName": ["MStore API – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
