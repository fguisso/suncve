The vulnerability exists because the affected software has user accounts with default, static passwords. An attacker with access to the NFVIS CLI of an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by logging into the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the NFVIS CLI with administrator privileges."], "published": "2020-08-26T17:15:13.677", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
