There is Local Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM via a Stack Overflow in RTLCopyMemory (IOCTL 0x1b2150). An attacker can exploit this to elevate privileges from a medium-integrity process to SYSTEM. This can also be used to bypass kernel-level protections such as AV or PPL, because exploit code runs with high-integrity privileges and can be used in coordinated BYOVD (bring your own vulnerable driver) ransomware campaigns."], "published": "2023-10-10T19:15:09.530", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
