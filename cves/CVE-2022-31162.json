Prior to 0.41.0, it was possible for Slack OAuth client information to leak in application debug logs. Stricter and more secure debug formatting was introduced in v0.41.0 for OAuth secret types to reduce the possibility of printing sensitive information in application logs. As a workaround, do not print/output requests and responses for OAuth and client configurations in logs."], "published": "2022-07-22T04:15:14.187", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["abdolence"], "productName": ["slack-morphism-rust"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/abdolence/slack-morphism-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-99j7-mhfh-w84p"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/abdolence/slack-morphism-rust/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["rust", "rust-crate", "slack", "slack-api"], "langs": {"Rust": 390788}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1316837?v=4", "stargazers": 179, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
