Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0."], "published": "2021-05-17T20:15:07.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-react-sdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-8796-gc9j-63rv"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "matrix", "matrix-chat", "matrix-sdk"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 13326839, "CSS": 1012051, "JavaScript": 32699, "Shell": 6707, "Python": 5019, "HTML": 2809, "Dockerfile": 350}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 1106, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
