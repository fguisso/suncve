For example, when PAGE_SIZE_4KB is enabled and\nMIPS_VA_BITS_48 is not enabled in a 64bit system, the macro \"PGD_ORDER\"\nwill be set as \"1\", which will cause allocating two pages as the pgd\ntable. Well, at the same time, the generic implementation pgd_free()\njust free one pgd page, which will result in the memory leak.\n\nThe memory leak can be easily detected by executing shell command:\n\"while true; do ls > /dev/null; grep MemFree /proc/meminfo; done\""], "published": "2025-02-26T07:00:58.107", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
