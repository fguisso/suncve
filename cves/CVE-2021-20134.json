Subsequent log messages will be appended to the file, prefixed by a timestamp and some logging metadata. Remote code execution can be achieved by using this vulnerability to append to a shell script on the router's filesystem, and then awaiting or triggering the execution of that script. A remote, unauthenticated root shell can easily be obtained on the device in this fashion."], "published": "2021-12-30T22:15:08.460", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Quagga Services on D-Link DIR-2640 Routers"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
