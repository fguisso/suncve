In versions 0.59.0 and prior, if a malicious user has taken over a Kubernetes node where virt-handler (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is running, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs. This can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged components which can, for instance, read all secrets on the cluster, or can exec into pods on other nodes. This way, a compromised node can be used to elevate privileges beyond the node until potentially having full privileged access to the whole cluster. The simplest way to exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node, is to set with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on its node. No patches are available as of time of publication. As a workaround, gatekeeper users can add a webhook which will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify the spec of a node."], "published": "2023-03-15T21:15:08.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kubevirt"], "productName": ["kubevirt"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories/GHSA-cp96-jpmq-xrr2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "kubernetes", "libvirt", "virtualization", "vms"], "langs": {"Go": 15457403, "Starlark": 577127, "Shell": 301306, "Makefile": 9264, "Dockerfile": 6304, "C": 5370, "Python": 2743}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18700703?v=4", "stargazers": 5958, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
