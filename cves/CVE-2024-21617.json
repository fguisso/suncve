A manual reboot of the system will restore the services.\n\nNote: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.\nThe memory usage can be monitored using the below commands.\n\nuser@host> show chassis routing-engine no-forwarding\nuser@host> show system memory | no-more\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S5;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S4;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S2;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S2;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-S1, 22.3R3;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R1-S2, 22.4R2.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Junos OS versions earlier than 20.4R3-S7.\n\n\n\n"], "published": "2024-01-12T01:15:50.230", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
