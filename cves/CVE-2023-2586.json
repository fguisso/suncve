If the user has not disabled the \"RMS management feature\" enabled by default, then an attacker could register that device to themselves. This could enable the attacker to perform different operations on the user's devices, including remote code execution with 'root' privileges (using the 'Task Manager' feature on RMS).\n\n"], "published": "2023-05-22T16:15:09.597", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Teltonika"], "productName": ["Remote Management System"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
