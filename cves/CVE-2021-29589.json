The reference implementation of the `GatherNd` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L966). An attacker can craft a model such that `params` input would be an empty tensor. In turn, `params_shape.Dims(.)` would be zero, in at least one dimension. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
