An attacker can upload arbitrary files through amavis via a cpio loophole (extraction to /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public) that can lead to incorrect access to any other user accounts. Zimbra recommends pax over cpio. Also, pax is in the prerequisites of Zimbra on Ubuntu; however, pax is no longer part of a default Red Hat installation after RHEL 6 (or CentOS 6). Once pax is installed, amavis automatically prefers it over cpio."], "published": "2022-09-26T02:15:10.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/segfault-it/cve-2022-41352", "https://github.com/Cr4ckC4t/cve-2022-41352-zimbra-rce", "https://github.com/qailanet/cve-2022-41352-zimbra-rce", "https://github.com/segfault-it/cve-2022-41352", "https://github.com/Cr4ckC4t/cve-2022-41352-zimbra-rce", "https://github.com/qailanet/cve-2022-41352-zimbra-rce"]}
