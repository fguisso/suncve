In versions prior to 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1, requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler, which again could retrieve content to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. This vulnerability is very similar, but not identical, to the one described in CVE-2021-21359. This issue is patched in versions 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20 or 12.1.1."], "published": "2022-12-14T08:15:09.427", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["TYPO3"], "productName": ["typo3"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-8c28-5mp7-v24h"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "content-management", "enterprise", "php", "typo3"], "langs": {"PHP": 34836536, "TypeScript": 2559502, "HTML": 1956714, "CSS": 587310, "SCSS": 471817, "JavaScript": 217512, "Shell": 94459, "XSLT": 6781, "Batchfile": 412}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88698?v=4", "stargazers": 1099, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
