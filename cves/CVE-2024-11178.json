This is due to the plugin generating too weak OTP, and thereâ€™s no attempt or time limit. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate and brute force the 6-digit numeric OTP that makes it possible to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email."], "published": "2024-12-06T07:15:05.460", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["india-web-developer"], "productName": ["Login With OTP"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
