However, an attacker will not have developer or admin rights. If the implementation of the JWT-library is wrongly configured to accept \"none\"-algorithms, the server will pass insecure JWT. A local, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the authentication mechanism."], "published": "2024-06-06T13:15:32.027", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Volkswagen Group Charging GmbH - Elli, EVBox"], "productName": ["ID Charger Connect & Pro"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
