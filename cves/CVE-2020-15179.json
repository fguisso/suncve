Using <script> tag inside <scratchsig> tag, attackers with edit permission can execute scripts on visitors' browser. With MediaWiki JavaScript API, this can potentially lead to privilege escalation and/or account takeover. This has been patched in release 1.0.1. This has already been deployed to all Scratch Wikis. No workarounds exist other than disabling the extension completely."], "published": "2020-09-15T18:15:14.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["InternationalScratchWiki"], "productName": ["wiki-scratchsig"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig/security/advisories/GHSA-gp9v-pg9f-vmp6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig/commit/4160a39a20eebeb63a59eb7597a91b961eca6388"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 2591, "CSS": 88}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15742417?v=4", "stargazers": 0, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
