This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes."], "published": "2024-05-22T13:15:27.730", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["themehunk"], "productName": ["Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
