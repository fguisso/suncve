A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_jpeg_dec_negotiate function in gstjpegdec.c. This function does not check for a NULL return value from gst_video_decoder_set_output_state. When this happens, dereferences of the outstate pointer will lead to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:31.440", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
