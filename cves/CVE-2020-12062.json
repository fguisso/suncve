The victim must use the command scp -rp to download a file hierarchy containing, anywhere inside, this crafted subdirectory. NOTE: the vendor points out that \"this attack can achieve no more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve within the scp protocol\" and \"utimes does not fail under normal circumstances.\""], "published": "2020-06-01T16:15:14.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/955854cafca88e0cdcd3d09ca1ad4ada465364a1", "https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/aad87b88fc2536b1ea023213729aaf4eaabe1894"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "cryptography", "file-sharing", "keychain", "login", "security"], "langs": {"C": 5175805, "Shell": 462287, "Roff": 338925, "M4": 168407, "Makefile": 64293, "C++": 23707, "HTML": 22582, "Awk": 8595, "KRL": 7037}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2387206?v=4", "stargazers": 3288, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
