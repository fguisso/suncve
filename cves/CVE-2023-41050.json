Python's \"format\" functionality allows someone controlling the format string to \"read\" objects accessible (recursively) via attribute access and subscription from accessible objects. Those attribute accesses and subscriptions use Python's full blown `getattr` and `getitem`, not the policy restricted `AccessControl` variants `_getattr_` and `_getitem_`. This can lead to critical information disclosure. `AccessControl` already provides a safe variant for `str.format` and denies access to `string.Formatter`. However, `str.format_map` is still unsafe. Affected are all users who allow untrusted users to create `AccessControl` controlled Python code and execute it. A fix has been introduced in versions 4.4, 5.8 and 6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-09-06T18:15:08.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["zopefoundation"], "productName": ["AccessControl"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-8xv7-89vj-q48c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/commit/6bc32692e0d4b8d5cf64eae3d19de987c7375bc9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["python", "zope"], "langs": {"Python": 387668, "C": 68836, "C++": 9572, "Shell": 2438}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1163184?v=4", "stargazers": 13, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
