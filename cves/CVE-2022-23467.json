Using a modified USB device an attacker can leak stack addresses of the `razer_attr_read_dpi_stages`, potentially bypassing KASLR. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to access to a users keyboard or mouse or would need to convince a user to use a modified device. The issue has been patched in v3.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade and should be reminded not to plug in unknown USB devices."], "published": "2022-12-05T20:15:10.133", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["openrazer"], "productName": ["openrazer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/security/advisories/GHSA-39hg-jvc9-fg7h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/commit/33aa7f07d54ae066f201c6d298cb4a2181cb90e6"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["driver", "linux", "openrazer", "python", "razer", "razer-devices", "razer-drivers", "razer-peripherals"], "langs": {"C": 782753, "Python": 740562, "Shell": 24876, "Makefile": 7907, "Roff": 6017, "Lua": 4814}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25405085?v=4", "stargazers": 3845, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
