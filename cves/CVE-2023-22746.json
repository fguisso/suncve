When creating a new container based on one of the Docker images listed below, the same secret key was being used by default. If the users didn't set a custom value via environment variables in the `.env` file, that key was shared across different CKAN instances, making it easy to forge authentication requests. Users overriding the default secret key in their own `.env` file are not affected by this issue. Note that the legacy images (ckan/ckan) located in the main CKAN repo are not affected by this issue. The affected images are ckan/ckan-docker, (ckan/ckan-base images), okfn/docker-ckan (openknowledge/ckan-base and openknowledge/ckan-dev images) keitaroinc/docker-ckan (keitaro/ckan images)."], "published": "2023-02-03T22:15:11.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ckan"], "productName": ["ckan"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-pr8j-v4c8-h62x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/44af0f0a148fcc0e0fbcf02fe69b7db13459a84b", "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/4c22c135fa486afa13855d1cdb9765eaf418d2aa"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "catalog", "ckan", "ckanext", "data", "digitalpublicgoods", "dpg", "open-data", "python", "sdg16"], "langs": {"Python": 4167677, "CSS": 1354678, "HTML": 831894, "JavaScript": 590575, "SCSS": 301038, "Shell": 7874, "Gherkin": 4881, "PLpgSQL": 4227, "Mako": 4140, "Dockerfile": 1045, "Smarty": 516}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630326?v=4", "stargazers": 4654, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
