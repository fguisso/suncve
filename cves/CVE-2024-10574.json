This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Sheets integration credentials within the plugin's settings. Because the 'client_id' parameter is not sanitized or escaped when used in output, this vulnerability could also be leveraged to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."], "published": "2025-01-26T06:15:22.790", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["AYS Pro Plugins"], "productName": ["Quiz Maker Developer", "Quiz Maker Agency", "Quiz Maker Business"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
