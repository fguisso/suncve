An attacker can also capture and replay Z-Wave traffic. Firmware upgrades cannot directly address this vulnerability as it is an issue with the Z-Wave specification for these legacy chipsets. One way to protect against this vulnerability is to use 500 or 700 series chipsets that support Security 2 (S2) encryption. As examples, the Linear WADWAZ-1 version 3.43 and WAPIRZ-1 version 3.43 (with 300 series chipsets) are vulnerable."], "published": "2022-01-10T14:10:16.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linear", "Silicon Labs"], "productName": ["WADWAZ-1", "WAPIRZ-1", "100 series", "200 series", "300 series"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
