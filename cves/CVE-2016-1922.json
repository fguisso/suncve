It occurs while doing I/O port write operations via hmp interface. In that, 'current_cpu' remains null, which leads to the null pointer dereference. A user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance, resulting in DoS issue."], "published": "2016-12-29T22:59:00.370", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
