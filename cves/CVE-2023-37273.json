Running Auto-GPT version prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection. This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands, it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3."], "published": "2023-07-13T23:15:10.747", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Significant-Gravitas"], "productName": ["Auto-GPT"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-x5gj-2chr-4ch6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "artificial-intelligence", "autonomous-agents", "gpt-4", "openai", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 2878491, "TypeScript": 1258928, "Dart": 203562, "PLpgSQL": 44427, "Jinja": 31626, "C++": 23419, "CMake": 18862, "JavaScript": 14039, "MDX": 12901, "CSS": 10735, "Shell": 5870, "Dockerfile": 4777, "HTML": 3023, "Ruby": 2803, "Swift": 2384, "C": 1425, "Elixir": 1068, "Batchfile": 478, "Kotlin": 140, "Objective-C": 38}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130738209?v=4", "stargazers": 174211, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
