Starting with version 5.2.0, there is a possible sensitive session information leak in Active Storage. By default, Active Storage sends a Set-Cookie header along with the user's session cookie when serving blobs. It also sets Cache-Control to public. Certain proxies may cache the Set-Cookie, leading to an information leak. The vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.8.1 and 6.1.7.7."], "published": "2024-02-27T16:15:46.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rails"], "productName": ["rails"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-8h22-8cf7-hq6g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/723f54566023e91060a67b03353e7c03e7436433", "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/78fe149509fac5b05e54187aaaef216fbb5fd0d3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rails/rails/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activejob", "activerecord", "framework", "html", "mvc", "rails", "ruby"], "langs": {"Ruby": 17256286, "JavaScript": 228123, "HTML": 196993, "SCSS": 50596, "CSS": 46738, "Dockerfile": 2019, "Shell": 810}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4223?v=4", "stargazers": 56700, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/gmo-ierae/CVE-2024-26144-test", "https://github.com/gmo-ierae/CVE-2024-26144-test"]}
