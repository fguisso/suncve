Prior to version 1.2.0, memory corruption can be triggered when decoding UTF16 strings. The variable `outlen` was not initialized and could cause writing a zero to an arbitrary place in memory if `ntlm_str_convert()` were to fail, which would leave `outlen` uninitialized. This can lead to a denial of service if the write hits unmapped memory or randomly corrupts a byte in the application memory space. This vulnerability can trigger an out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0."], "published": "2023-02-14T18:15:13.173", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gssapi"], "productName": ["gss-ntlmssp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-r85x-q5px-9xfq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/c753000eb31835c0664e528fbc99378ae0cbe950"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 476794, "M4": 9365, "Makefile": 6335, "Shell": 1817}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63316684?v=4", "stargazers": 31, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
