This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above and granted plugin setting edit permissions by an administrator, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."], "published": "2024-07-09T05:15:13.543", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["unitecms"], "productName": ["Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
