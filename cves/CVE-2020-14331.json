This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."], "published": "2020-09-15T19:15:12.667", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Linux Kernel"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
