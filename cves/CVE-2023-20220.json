To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid device credentials, but does not need Administrator privileges. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for certain configuration options. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using crafted input within the device configuration GUI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device, including on the underlying operating system, which could also affect the availability of the device."], "published": "2023-11-01T18:15:09.523", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Firepower Management Center"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
