An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make the application access any URL, including internal services, and read the response. This can be used to access data that are only accessible from the server, such as AWS metadata credentials, and can escalate local exploits to network-based attacks."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:28.633", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["binary-husky"], "productName": ["binary-husky/gpt_academic"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
