The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanity checks on an internal data structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of malicious SIP messages to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a crash of the iosd process. This triggers a reload of the device."], "published": "2019-09-25T21:15:10.717", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS 15.0(1)XA2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
