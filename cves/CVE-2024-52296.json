At ospd_common.c, on the osdp_reply_name function, any reply id between REPLY_ACK and REPLY_XRD is valid, but names array do not declare all of the range. On a case of an undefined reply id within the range, name will be null (name = names[reply_id - REPLY_ACK];). Null name will casue a crash on next line: if (name[0] == '\\0') as null[0] is invalid. As this logic is not limited to a secure connection, attacker may trigger this vulnerability without any prior knowledge. This issue is fixed in 2.4.0."], "published": "2024-11-12T16:15:26.030", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["goToMain"], "productName": ["libosdp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp/security/advisories/GHSA-7945-5mcv-f2pp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp/commit/24409e98a260176765956ec766a04cb35984fab1"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["osdp", "osdp-arduino", "osdp-python", "osdp-rust"], "langs": {"C": 309222, "Python": 51759, "CMake": 18751, "Shell": 15005, "Lua": 8412, "C++": 3018, "Makefile": 2012, "Nix": 352}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69145836?v=4", "stargazers": 154, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
