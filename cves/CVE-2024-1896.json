This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code."], "published": "2024-05-02T17:15:14.187", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["awordpresslife"], "productName": ["Photo Gallery – Responsive Photo Gallery, Image Gallery, Portfolio Gallery, Logo Gallery And Team Gallery"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
