With the default configuration of tls-listener, a malicious user can open 6.4 `TcpStream`s a second, sending 0 bytes, and can trigger a DoS. The default configuration options make any public service using `TlsListener::new()` vulnerable to a slow-loris DoS attack. This impacts any publicly accessible service using the default configuration of tls-listener in versions prior to 0.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this by passing a large value, such as `usize::MAX` as the parameter to `Builder::max_handshakes`.\n\n"], "published": "2024-03-15T19:15:07.627", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tmccombs"], "productName": ["tls-listener"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tmccombs/tls-listener/security/advisories/GHSA-2qph-qpvm-2qf7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tmccombs/tls-listener/commit/d5a7655d6ea9e53ab57c3013092c5576da964bc4"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/tmccombs/tls-listener/security/advisories/GHSA-2qph-qpvm-2qf7", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/tmccombs/tls-listener/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 27170}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2541726?v=4", "stargazers": 53, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
