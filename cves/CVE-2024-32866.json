Due to an improper implementation of this feature in versions prior to 1.1.1, an attacker can exploit the feature to trigger prototype pollution by passing a crafted input to `parseWith...` functions. Applications that use conform for server-side validation of form data or URL parameters are affected by this vulnerability. Version 1.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.\n"], "published": "2024-04-23T21:15:48.407", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["edmundhung"], "productName": ["conform"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/security/advisories/GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/commit/4819d51b5a53fd5486fc85c17cdc148eb160e3de"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/security/advisories/GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["form-validation", "nextjs", "progressive-enhancement", "react", "react-router", "remix-run", "validation"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 425934, "JavaScript": 12104, "CSS": 2009, "Shell": 58}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8258047?v=4", "stargazers": 2249, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
