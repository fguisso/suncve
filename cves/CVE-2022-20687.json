An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause LLDP to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."], "published": "2022-12-12T09:15:12.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
