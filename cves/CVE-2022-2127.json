When performing NTLM authentication, the client replies to cryptographic challenges back to the server. These replies have variable lengths, and Winbind fails to check the lan manager response length. When Winbind is used for NTLM authentication, a maliciously crafted request can trigger an out-of-bounds read in Winbind, possibly resulting in a crash."], "published": "2023-07-20T15:15:11.183", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Storage 3"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
