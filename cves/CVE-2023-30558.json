The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. User input coming from the `db_name` in the `sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_list` endpoint is passed to the methods that follow in a given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are `get_group_tables_by_db` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`which passes unsafe user input to `sql/engines/mssql.py`, and `get_group_tables_by_db` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-105`."], "published": "2023-04-19T00:15:09.780", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["hhyo"], "productName": ["Archery"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-jwjj-jgfv-x66q"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["archery", "binlog2sql", "clickhouse", "data-masking", "database-schema", "ddl", "dml", "gh-ost", "inception", "mysql", "oracle", "sql-audit", "sql-query"], "langs": {"Python": 2528286, "Shell": 10307, "Mustache": 2102, "Dockerfile": 873}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8842982?v=4", "stargazers": 6286, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
