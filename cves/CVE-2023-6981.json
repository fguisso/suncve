This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This can leveraged to achieve Reflected Cross-site Scripting."], "published": "2024-01-03T06:15:47.663", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mostafas1990"], "productName": ["WP SMS – Messaging & SMS Notification for WordPress, WooCommerce, GravityForms, etc"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/wp-sms/wp-sms/commit/6656de201efe67c7983102c344a546eed976a819"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/wp-sms/wp-sms/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["2fa", "gateways", "nexmo", "notification-sms", "plivo", "sms", "sms-newsletter", "sms-otp", "twilio", "woocommerce", "wordpress", "wp-sms"], "langs": {"PHP": 2047331, "JavaScript": 240927, "SCSS": 203214, "CSS": 30343, "Shell": 7174}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138309584?v=4", "stargazers": 102, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
