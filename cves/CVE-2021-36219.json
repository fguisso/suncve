The provided input for ECALL 14 triggers a branch in trustedEcdsaSign that frees a non-initialized pointer from the stack. An attacker can chain multiple enclave calls to prepare a stack that contains a valid address. This address is then freed, resulting in compromised integrity of the enclave. This was resolved after v1.58.3 and not reproducible in sgxwallet v1.77.0."], "published": "2021-09-27T14:15:08.537", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/commit/4e9b5b7526db083177e81f8bafeaa4914d276a82"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blockchain", "bls-signature", "cpp", "ecdsa", "ethereum", "hardware-crypto-wallet", "proof-of-stake", "sgx", "skale-network", "trusted-computing", "trusted-execution-environment", "ubuntu", "wallet"], "langs": {"Shell": 976075, "C++": 462258, "C": 127051, "Makefile": 47646, "M4": 21210, "Python": 13405, "CMake": 2481, "Dockerfile": 522}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49560738?v=4", "stargazers": 65, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
