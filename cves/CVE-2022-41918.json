There is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to the indices that back data streams potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. OpenSearch 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-11-15T23:15:28.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["opensearch-project"], "productName": ["security"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-wmx7-x4jp-9jgg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/commit/f7cc569c9d3fa5d5432c76c854eed280d45ce6f4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 7179732, "Shell": 10421, "JavaScript": 2878, "Batchfile": 2189}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80134844?v=4", "stargazers": 211, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
