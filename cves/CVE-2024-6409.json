If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server."], "published": "2024-07-08T18:15:09.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
