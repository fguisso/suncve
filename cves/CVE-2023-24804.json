Prior to version 3.0, the app has an incomplete fix for a path traversal issue and is vulnerable to two bypass methods. The bypasses may lead to information disclosure when uploading the appâ€™s internal files, and to arbitrary file write when uploading plain text files (although limited by the .txt extension). Version 3.0 fixes the reported bypasses."], "published": "2023-02-13T17:15:11.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ownCloud"], "productName": ["Android"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
