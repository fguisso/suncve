Prior to version 0.3.0, default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys and the lock isn't emitted. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, using a lock on a `default` function is a very sparsely used pattern. As such, the impact is low. Version 0.3.0 contains a patch for the issue.\n"], "published": "2024-04-25T18:15:09.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vyperlang"], "productName": ["vyper"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-m2v9-w374-5hj9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/93287e5ac184b53b395c907d40701f721daf8177"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-m2v9-w374-5hj9", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ethereum", "ethereum-dapp", "language", "python", "vyper"], "langs": {"Python": 2779484, "Makefile": 2222, "Batchfile": 1614, "Dockerfile": 1145, "Shell": 793}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57152025?v=4", "stargazers": 5011, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
