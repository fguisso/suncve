An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a modified software image. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system and elevate their privileges to root.\r\nNote: Administrators should always validate the hash of any upgrade image before uploading it to Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud Network Controller."], "published": "2024-08-28T17:15:10.220", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
