An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, Web Access must be enabled on the phone and the attacker must have Admin credentials on the device. Web Access is disabled by default."], "published": "2024-11-06T17:15:18.927", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IP Phones with Multiplatform Firmware", "Cisco Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
