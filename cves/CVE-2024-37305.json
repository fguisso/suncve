Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with DECODE_UINT32 at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes; malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage. Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected. This issue has been patched in in v0.6.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2024-06-17T20:15:12.880", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["open-quantum-safe"], "productName": ["oqs-provider"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/security/advisories/GHSA-pqvr-5cr8-v6fx"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cryptography", "openssl", "post-quantum", "provider"], "langs": {"C": 666554, "C++": 77348, "Roff": 40708, "Python": 37567, "Shell": 32985, "CMake": 13433, "Ruby": 1332}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4", "stargazers": 309, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
