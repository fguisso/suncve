Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`, malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized. This allows for a bypass of the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7 and 2.0.16 of the `typo3/html-sanitizer` package. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-09-13T17:15:08.250", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["TYPO3"], "productName": ["html-sanitizer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-47m6-46mj-p235"], "commits": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/commit/60bfdc7f9b394d0236e16ee4cea8372a7defa493"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["html", "parser", "php", "sanitization", "security", "xss"], "langs": {"PHP": 133157}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88698?v=4", "stargazers": 27, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
