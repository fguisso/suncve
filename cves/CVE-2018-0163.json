The vulnerability is due to a logic change error introduced into the code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to access an 802.1x multi-auth port after a successful supplicant has authenticated. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the 802.1x access controls and obtain access to the network.
