In affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used to encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means that in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions: `3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins."], "published": "2022-10-06T18:16:00.783", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rabbitmq"], "productName": ["rabbitmq-server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/security/advisories/GHSA-v9gv-xp36-jgj8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["amqp", "amqp-0-9-1", "amqp1-0", "message-broker", "messaging", "mqtt", "rabbitmq", "stomp", "streaming", "streams"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 114709, "Shell": 71388, "Makefile": 34738, "Dockerfile": 3145, "HTML": 1087, "Erlang": 527}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96669?v=4", "stargazers": 12659, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
