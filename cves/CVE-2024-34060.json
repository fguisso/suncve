The `iris-evtx-module` is a pipeline plugin of `iris-web` that processes EVTX files through IRIS web application. During the upload of an EVTX through this pipeline, the filename is not safely handled and may cause an Arbitrary File Write. This can lead to a remote code execution (RCE) when combined with a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI). This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.0.0."], "published": "2024-05-23T12:15:10.807", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dfir-iris"], "productName": ["iris-evtx-module"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-evtx-module/security/advisories/GHSA-9rw6-5q9j-82fm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-evtx-module/commit/4e45fc94a31e1ee4641d608a387dfd9f9e68dbca"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-evtx-module/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["forensic", "incident-response"], "langs": {"Python": 21281}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95911680?v=4", "stargazers": 8, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
