When an AJP request is sent that exceeds the max-header-size attribute in ajp-listener, JBoss EAP is marked in an error state by mod_cluster in httpd, causing JBoss EAP to close the TCP connection without returning an AJP response. This happens because mod_proxy_cluster marks the JBoss EAP instance as an error worker when the TCP connection is closed from the backend after sending the AJP request without receiving an AJP response, and stops forwarding. This issue could allow a malicious user could to repeatedly send requests that exceed the max-header-size, causing a Denial of Service (DoS)."], "published": "2023-12-12T22:15:22.410", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat build of Quarkus", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Decision Manager 7", "Red Hat Fuse 7", "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6", "Red Hat Process Automation 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7", "Red Hat support for Spring Boot"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
