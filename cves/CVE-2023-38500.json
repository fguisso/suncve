Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem."], "published": "2023-07-25T21:15:11.083", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["TYPO3"], "productName": ["html-sanitizer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-59jf-3q9v-rh6g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/commit/e3026f589fef0be8c3574ee3f0a0bfbe33d7ebdb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["html", "parser", "php", "sanitization", "security", "xss"], "langs": {"PHP": 133157}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88698?v=4", "stargazers": 27, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
