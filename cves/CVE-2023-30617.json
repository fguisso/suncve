Starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2, an attacker who has gained root privilege of the node that kruise-daemon run can leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list all secrets in the entire cluster. After that, the attacker can leverage the \"captured\" secrets (e.g. the kruise-manager service account token) to gain extra privileges such as pod modification. Versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2 fix this issue. A workaround is available. For users that do not require imagepulljob functions, they can modify kruise-daemon-role to drop the cluster level secret get/list privilege."], "published": "2024-01-03T16:15:08.117", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["openkruise"], "productName": ["kruise"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/openkruise/kruise/security/advisories/GHSA-437m-7hj5-9mpw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/openkruise/kruise/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-native", "cloudnative", "cncf", "container", "k8s", "kruise", "kubernetes", "openkruise", "workload", "workloads"], "langs": {"Go": 5580024, "Shell": 45469, "Makefile": 8489, "Dockerfile": 1557}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49735278?v=4", "stargazers": 4807, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
