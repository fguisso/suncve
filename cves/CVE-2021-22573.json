Signature verification makes sure that the token's payload comes from valid provider, not from someone else. An attacker can provide a compromised token with custom payload. The token will pass the validation on the client side. We recommend upgrading to version 1.33.3 or above"], "published": "2022-05-03T16:15:18.700", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Google LLC"], "productName": ["Google-oauth-java-client"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
