However, there's an observed anomaly in the H2-DM1E PLC's protocol execution, namely its acceptance of multiple distinct packets as valid authentication responses. This behavior deviates from standard security practices where a single, specific response or encoding pattern is expected for successful authentication."], "published": "2024-09-13T17:15:12.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["AutomationDirect"], "productName": ["DirectLogic H2-DM1E"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
