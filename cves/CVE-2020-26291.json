In URI.js before version 1.19.4, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\\`) character followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect. Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior. For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\\@observed-example.com` will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the WHATWG URL specification, including web browsers and Node's built-in URL class. Version 1.19.4 is patched against all known payload variants. Version 1.19.3 has a partial patch but is still vulnerable to a payload variant.]"], "published": "2020-12-31T00:15:12.327", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["medialize"], "productName": ["URI.js"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/security/advisories/GHSA-3329-pjwv-fjpg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/commit/b02bf037c99ac9316b77ff8bfd840e90becf1155"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "rfc-2732", "rfc-3986", "rfc-6570", "uri", "uri-template", "url", "url-parser"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 377871, "HTML": 120393, "CSS": 9642, "PHP": 1226}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/435893?v=4", "stargazers": 6255, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
