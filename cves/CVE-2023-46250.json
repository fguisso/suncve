An attacker who uses a vulnerability present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations. The issue was fixed in version 3.17.0. As a workaround, apply the patch manually by modifying `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`."], "published": "2023-10-31T16:15:09.930", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["py-pdf"], "productName": ["pypdf"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-wjcc-cq79-p63f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/commit/9b23ac3c9619492570011d551d521690de9a3e2d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["help-wanted", "pdf", "pdf-documents", "pdf-manipulation", "pdf-parser", "pdf-parsing", "pypdf2", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 1696369, "Makefile": 774}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102914013?v=4", "stargazers": 8902, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
