In affected versions when ext-authz extension is sending request headers to the external authorization service it must merge multiple value headers according to the HTTP spec. However, only the last header value is sent. This may allow specifically crafted requests to bypass authorization. Attackers may be able to escalate privileges when using ext-authz extension or back end service that uses multiple value headers for authorization. A specifically constructed request may be delivered by an untrusted downstream peer in the presence of ext-authz extension. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to the ext-authz extension to correctly merge multiple request header values, when sending request for authorization."], "published": "2021-08-24T21:15:06.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["envoyproxy"], "productName": ["envoy"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-6g4j-5vrw-2m8h"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cars", "cats", "cats-over-dogs", "cncf", "corgis", "more-cats", "nanoservices", "rocket-ships"], "langs": {"C++": 49350623, "Starlark": 3216959, "Java": 1325292, "Python": 604792, "Assembly": 327095, "Kotlin": 310645, "Swift": 250537, "Go": 247548, "Shell": 232235, "Rust": 139702, "C": 70169, "JavaScript": 66339, "Objective-C++": 55490, "Objective-C": 48840, "Jinja": 47798, "Smarty": 3528, "CSS": 2927, "HTML": 1522, "Emacs Lisp": 966, "Dockerfile": 960, "Thrift": 748, "PureBasic": 472, "Batchfile": 439, "Makefile": 303}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30125649?v=4", "stargazers": 25769, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
