In Panindex prior to version 3.1.3, a hard-coded JWT key `PanIndex` is used. An attacker can use the hard-coded JWT key to sign JWT token and perform any actions as a user with admin privileges. Version 3.1.3 has a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may change the JWT key in the source code before compiling the project."], "published": "2023-03-13T21:15:14.130", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["px-org"], "productName": ["PanIndex"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/security/advisories/GHSA-82wq-gmw8-g87v"], "commits": ["https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/commit/f7ec0c5739af055ad3a825a20294a5c01ada3302"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 1895530, "Dockerfile": 531}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127071970?v=4", "stargazers": 1360, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
