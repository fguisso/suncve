Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF)."], "published": "2025-02-11T16:15:51.610", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["misskey-dev"], "productName": ["misskey"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-38w6-vx8g-67pp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/77e421029cb564a97f42b6e41c9edce49f79cecd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activitypub", "federation", "fediverse", "microblog", "misskey"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5814681, "Vue": 2650866, "JavaScript": 573863, "SCSS": 25333, "Pug": 21058, "CSS": 5402, "Dockerfile": 5117, "Shell": 1794, "Smarty": 1782, "HTML": 1243, "MDX": 575, "Procfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81036415?v=4", "stargazers": 10468, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
