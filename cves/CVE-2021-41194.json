When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.0 allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade to version 1.0.0 or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade occurs."], "published": "2021-10-28T20:15:07.680", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jupyterhub"], "productName": ["firstuseauthenticator"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-5xvc-vgmp-jgc3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"Python": 21919, "HTML": 880}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17927519?v=4", "stargazers": 50, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
