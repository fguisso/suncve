The Matrix Federation API allows remote homeservers to request the authorization events in a room. This is necessary so that a homeserver receiving some events can validate that those events are legitimate and permitted in their room. However, in versions of Synapse up to and including 1.68.0, a Synapse homeserver answering a query for authorization events does not sufficiently check that the requesting server should be able to access them. The issue was patched in Synapse 1.69.0. Homeserver administrators are advised to upgrade."], "published": "2023-05-26T14:15:09.600", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["synapse"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-45cj-f97f-ggwv"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["matrix-org", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 11907179, "Rust": 95720, "HTML": 64571, "Shell": 59187, "Perl": 28191, "Nix": 12267, "Dockerfile": 12096, "JavaScript": 11988, "Jinja": 7942, "CSS": 6211, "Makefile": 634, "Gherkin": 308, "Lua": 241}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 11875, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
