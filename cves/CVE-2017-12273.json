The vulnerability is due to insufficient frame validation of the 802.11 association request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed 802.11 association request to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the AP to reload, resulting in a DoS condition while the AP is reloading. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products running either the Lightweight AP Software or Mobility Express image: Aironet 1560 Series Access Points, Aironet 2800 Series Access Points, Aironet 3800 Series Access Points. Note: The Cisco Aironet 1560 Series Access Point device is supported as of release 8.3.112.0.
