By crafting malicious XML content that exploits inefficient regular expression complexity used in the parsing process, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability allows for the system to hang and consume significant resources, potentially rendering services that utilize Scrapy for XML processing unresponsive."], "published": "2024-02-28T00:15:53.897", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["scrapy"], "productName": ["scrapy/scrapy"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/commit/479619b340f197a8f24c5db45bc068fb8755f2c5"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["crawler", "crawling", "framework", "hacktoberfest", "python", "scraping", "web-scraping", "web-scraping-python"], "langs": {"Python": 2353613, "HTML": 3290, "Roff": 2010, "Shell": 252}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/733635?v=4", "stargazers": 54786, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
