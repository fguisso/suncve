An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: SD-WAN tunnels that are configured with Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) are not affected by this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-09-25T17:15:16.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XE Software", "Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
