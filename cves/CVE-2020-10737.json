This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this issue by creating a symlink point to a target folder, which then has its ownership transferred to the new home directory's unprivileged user."], "published": "2020-05-27T01:15:09.230", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["oddjob"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
