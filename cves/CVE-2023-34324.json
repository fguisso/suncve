As this action will cause console\nmessages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance of\ntriggering the deadlock is not neglectable.\n\nNote that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit Linux kernel\non Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger the\nissue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers to get\nthe lock).\n"], "published": "2024-01-05T17:15:08.540", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
