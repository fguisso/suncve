The `secretKey` value is an important key for HMAC SHA256 authentication and in affected versions was stored in the database in cleartext form. If a malicious person somehow had access to the data in the database, they could use the key and secretKey for HMAC SHA256 authentication to send requests impersonating that corresponding user. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0-beta.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-11-24T18:15:07.327", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["codeigniter4"], "productName": ["shield"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/security/advisories/GHSA-v427-c49j-8w6x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/commit/f77c6ae20275ac1245330a2b9a523bf7e6f6202f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["auth", "authentication", "authorization", "codeigniter4"], "langs": {"PHP": 886900, "Shell": 1111}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44521256?v=4", "stargazers": 383, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
