An attacker with access to a HTTP-request intercepting method is able to bypass authentication and authorization by removing the SAML Assertion Signature - impersonating existing users and existing roles, including administrative users/roles. This vulnerability is not mitigated by configuring the module to enforce signatures or certificate checks. Xecurify recommends updating miniOrange modules to their most recent versions. This vulnerability is present in paid versions of the miniOrange Drupal SAML SP product affecting Drupal 7, 8, and 9."], "published": "2022-06-03T18:15:09.207", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Xecuify"], "productName": ["Drupal 8 miniOrange SAML SP", "Drupal 9 miniOrange SAML SP", "Drupal 7 miniOrange SAML SP"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
