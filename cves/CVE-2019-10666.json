Several of the scripts perform dynamic script inclusion via the include() function on user supplied input without sanitizing the values by calling basename() or a similar function. An attacker can leverage this to execute PHP code from the included file. Exploitation of these scripts is made difficult by additional text being appended (typically .inc.php), which means an attacker would need to be able to control both a filename and its content on the server. However, exploitation can be achieved as demonstrated by the csv.php?report=../ substring."], "published": "2019-09-09T13:15:11.357", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
