This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice 'setup_len' exceeds its 'data_buf[4096]' in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host."], "published": "2020-08-31T18:15:12.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["QEMU"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/gejian-iscas/CVE-2020-14364", "https://github.com/y-f00l/CVE-2020-14364", "https://github.com/gejian-iscas/CVE-2020-14364", "https://github.com/y-f00l/CVE-2020-14364"]}
