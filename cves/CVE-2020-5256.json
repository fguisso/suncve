They would then have the permissions of the PHP process. This most impacts scenarios where non-trusted users are given permission to upload images in any area of the application. The issue was addressed in a series of patches in versions 0.25.3, 0.25.4 and 0.25.5. Users should upgrade to at least v0.25.5 to avoid this vulnerability."], "published": "2020-03-09T16:15:15.750", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["BookStackApp"], "productName": ["BookStack"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-g9rq-x4fj-f5hx"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bookstack", "documentation", "laravel", "php", "selfhosted", "wiki"], "langs": {"PHP": 8284458, "TypeScript": 1873399, "Blade": 456401, "JavaScript": 288502, "SCSS": 139861, "Dockerfile": 1282, "Shell": 347}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20912696?v=4", "stargazers": 16367, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
