This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0."], "published": "2019-12-20T23:15:11.167", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Pylons"], "productName": ["Waitress"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-pg36-wpm5-g57p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/8eba394ad75deaf9e5cd15b78a3d16b12e6b0eba"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["http-server", "python", "wsgi-server"], "langs": {"Python": 495249}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/452227?v=4", "stargazers": 1489, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
