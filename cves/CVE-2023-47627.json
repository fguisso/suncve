The HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header parsing, which could lead to request smuggling. This parser is only used when AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel). These bugs have been addressed in commit `d5c12ba89` which has been included in release version 3.8.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues."], "published": "2023-11-14T21:15:12.820", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aio-libs"], "productName": ["aiohttp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/d5c12ba890557a575c313bb3017910d7616fce3d"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aiohttp", "async", "asyncio", "hacktoberfest", "http", "http-client", "http-server", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 2266388, "Cython": 41308, "Makefile": 5929, "Gherkin": 1248, "Dockerfile": 298, "C": 170, "Shell": 148}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7049303?v=4", "stargazers": 15561, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
