A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2025-02-18T20:15:33.153", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Exiv2"], "productName": ["exiv2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-38h4-fx85-qcx7"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cli", "exif", "exif-interface", "exif-metadata", "image-metadata", "iptc", "iptc-metadata", "xmp", "xmp-metadata"], "langs": {"C++": 4300067, "Python": 937903, "CMake": 61321, "C": 35700, "Meson": 13772, "Shell": 8085, "Batchfile": 914, "CodeQL": 599, "QMake": 392, "sed": 370}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23559442?v=4", "stargazers": 995, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
