A vulnerability was discovered in Argo CD that exposed secret values in error messages and the diff view when an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource was synced from a repository. The vulnerability assumes the user has write access to the repository and can exploit it, either intentionally or unintentionally, by committing an invalid Secret to repository and triggering a Sync. Once exploited, any user with read access to Argo CD can view the exposed secret data. The vulnerability is fixed in v2.13.4, v2.12.10, and v2.11.13."], "published": "2025-01-30T16:15:31.473", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["argoproj"], "productName": ["argo-cd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-47g2-qmh2-749v"], "commits": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/6f5537bdf15ddbaa0f27a1a678632ff0743e4107", "https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/commit/7e21b91e9d0f64104c8a661f3f390c5e6d73ddca"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["continuous-deployment", "gitops", "kubernetes"], "langs": {"Go": 452042, "Shell": 1019, "Makefile": 847, "Dockerfile": 315}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30269780?v=4", "stargazers": 1737, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
