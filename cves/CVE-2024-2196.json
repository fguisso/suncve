The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF and CORS protection in the aim dashboard. An attacker can exploit this by tricking a user into executing a malicious script that sends unauthorized requests to the aim server, leading to potential data loss and unauthorized data manipulation."], "published": "2024-04-10T17:15:54.257", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aimhubio"], "productName": ["aimhubio/aim"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
