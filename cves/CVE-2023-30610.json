The `aws_sigv4::SigningParams` struct had a derived `Debug` implementation. When debug-formatted, it would include a user's AWS access key, AWS secret key, and security token in plaintext. When TRACE-level logging is enabled for an SDK, `SigningParams` is printed, thereby revealing those credentials to anyone with access to logs. All users of the AWS SDK for Rust who enabled TRACE-level logging, either globally (e.g. `RUST_LOG=trace`), or for the `aws-sigv4` crate specifically are affected. This issue has been addressed in a set of new releases. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable TRACE-level logging for AWS Rust SDK crates.\n"], "published": "2023-04-19T18:15:07.417", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["awslabs"], "productName": ["aws-sdk-rust"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-mjv9-vp6w-3rc9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aws", "rust"], "langs": {"Rust": 1456008672, "Python": 13085, "Shell": 7182, "TypeScript": 3869, "JavaScript": 1364}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3299148?v=4", "stargazers": 3121, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
