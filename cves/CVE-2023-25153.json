Before versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18, when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images."], "published": "2023-02-16T15:15:19.477", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["containerd"], "productName": ["containerd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/0c314901076a74a7b797a545d2f462285fdbb8c4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "containerd", "containers", "cri", "docker", "hacktoberfest", "kubernetes", "oci"], "langs": {"Go": 5509619, "Shell": 110628, "Makefile": 26121, "PowerShell": 6191, "jq": 4089, "Dockerfile": 3995}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14037953?v=4", "stargazers": 18212, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
