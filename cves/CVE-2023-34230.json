In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue."], "published": "2023-06-08T21:15:17.513", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["snowflakedb"], "productName": ["snowflake-connector-net"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/security/advisories/GHSA-223g-8w3x-98wr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["csharp", "database", "dotnet", "sql"], "langs": {"C#": 2270918, "Shell": 9781, "Batchfile": 1412}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6453780?v=4", "stargazers": 186, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
