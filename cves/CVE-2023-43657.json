Improper escaping of encrypted topic titles could lead to a cross site scripting (XSS) issue when a site has content security policy (CSP) headers disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, and having it disabled with discourse-encrypt installed will result in a warning in the Discourse admin dashboard. This has been fixed in commit `9c75810af9` which is included in the latest version of the discourse-encrypt plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that CSP headers are enabled and properly configured."], "published": "2023-09-28T19:15:10.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["discourse-encrypt"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/security/advisories/GHSA-5fh6-wp7p-xx7v"], "commits": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/commit/9c75810af9a474d7edaec67dea66f852c0ba1f4e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["discourse-plugin"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 234918, "Ruby": 104472, "Handlebars": 12046, "SCSS": 3848}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 43, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
