A specially crafted value of the `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` header can be used to significantly slow down a ws server. The vulnerability has been fixed in ws@7.4.6 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/00c425ec77993773d823f018f64a5c44e17023ff). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated by reducing the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_max_http_header_size_size) and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener) options."], "published": "2021-05-25T19:15:07.767", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["websockets"], "productName": ["ws"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-6fc8-4gx4-v693"], "commits": ["https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/00c425ec77993773d823f018f64a5c44e17023ff"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-6fc8-4gx4-v693", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/websockets/ws/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "node", "nodejs", "real-time", "rfc-6455", "websocket", "websocket-client", "websocket-compression", "websocket-server"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 433642}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10721323?v=4", "stargazers": 22125, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
