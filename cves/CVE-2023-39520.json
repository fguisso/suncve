The MSI installer provided on the homepage for Cryptomator version 1.9.2 allows local privilege escalation for low privileged users, via the `repair` function. The problem occurs as the repair function of the MSI is spawning an SYSTEM Powershell without the `-NoProfile` parameter. Therefore the profile of the user starting the repair will be loaded. Version 1.9.3 contains a fix for this issue. Adding a `-NoProfile` to the powershell is a possible workaround."], "published": "2023-08-07T20:15:09.987", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["cryptomator"], "productName": ["cryptomator"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/security/advisories/GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/727c32ad50c3901a6144a11cf984a3b7ebcf8b2b"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/security/advisories/GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept", "steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-storage", "crypto", "cryptography", "cryptomator", "encryption", "java", "privacy", "security"], "langs": {"Java": 971326, "CSS": 59574, "FreeMarker": 1482}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11850518?v=4", "stargazers": 12652, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
