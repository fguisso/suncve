A user with permission to create comments could POST HTML directly to the system to be saved in a comment, which would then be executed/displayed to others users viewing the comment. Through this vulnerability custom JavaScript code could be injected and therefore ran on other user machines. This most impacts scenarios where not-trusted users are given permission to create comments. This has been fixed in 0.29.2."], "published": "2020-05-07T21:15:11.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["BookStackApp"], "productName": ["BookStack"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-5vf7-q87h-pg6w"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bookstack", "documentation", "laravel", "php", "selfhosted", "wiki"], "langs": {"PHP": 8284458, "TypeScript": 1873399, "Blade": 456401, "JavaScript": 288502, "SCSS": 139861, "Dockerfile": 1282, "Shell": 347}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20912696?v=4", "stargazers": 16367, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
