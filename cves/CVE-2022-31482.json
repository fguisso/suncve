This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.29. The overflowed data leads to segmentation fault and ultimately a denial-of-service condition, causing the device to reboot. The impact of this vulnerability is that an unauthenticated attacker could leverage this flaw to cause the target device to become unresponsive. An attacker could automate this attack to achieve persistent DoS, effectively rendering the target controller useless."], "published": "2022-06-06T17:15:11.210", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["LenelS2", "HID Mercury"], "productName": ["LNL-X2210", "LNL-X2220", "LNL-X3300", "LNL-X4420", "LNL-4420", "S2-LP-1501", "S2-LP-1502", "S2-LP-2500", "S2-LP-4502", "LP1501", "LP1502", "LP2500", "LP4502", "EP4502"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
