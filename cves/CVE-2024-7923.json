This issue arises from Apache's mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header. This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) which are using Pulpcore version 3.0+ and could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain administrative access."], "published": "2024-09-04T14:15:14.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Satellite 6.13 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Satellite 6.14 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Satellite 6.15 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Satellite 6.16 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Satellite 6.16 for RHEL 9"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
