In Nanopb before versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5, decoding a specifically formed message can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the message type contains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly contains both a pointer field and a non-pointer field. If the message data first contains the non-pointer field and then the pointer field, the data of the non-pointer field is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer value. Such message data rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed. This has been fixed in versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5. See referenced GitHub Security Advisory for more information including workarounds."], "published": "2021-03-23T18:15:13.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nanopb"], "productName": ["nanopb"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/security/advisories/GHSA-7mv5-5mxh-qg88"], "commits": ["https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/commit/e2f0ccf939d9f82931d085acb6df8e9a182a4261"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "embedded", "embedded-c", "nanopb", "protocol-buffers"], "langs": {"C": 513786, "Python": 238261, "C++": 52886, "CMake": 26668, "Shell": 10945, "Starlark": 10145, "Makefile": 1683, "Swift": 1485, "Batchfile": 957, "Dockerfile": 852, "Objective-C": 141, "MATLAB": 16}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12173937?v=4", "stargazers": 4573, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/uthrasri/CVE-2021-21401_nanopb-c_AOSP10_R33", "https://github.com/uthrasri/CVE-2021-21401_nanopb-c_AOSP10_R33"]}
