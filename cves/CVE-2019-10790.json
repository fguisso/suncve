However, it is found that the internal index can be forged by adding additional properties into user-input. If index is found in the query, taffyDB will ignore other query conditions and directly return the indexed data item. Moreover, the internal index is in an easily-guessable format (e.g., T000002R000001). As such, attackers can use this vulnerability to access any data items in the DB."], "published": "2020-02-17T20:15:10.943", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["taffy npm module"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
