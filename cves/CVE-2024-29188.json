The custom action behind WiX's `RemoveFolderEx` functionality could allow a standard user to delete protected directories. `RemoveFolderEx` deletes an entire directory tree during installation or uninstallation. It does so by recursing every subdirectory starting at a specified directory and adding each subdirectory to the list of directories Windows Installer should delete. If the setup author instructed `RemoveFolderEx` to delete a per-user folder from a per-machine installer, an attacker could create a directory junction in that per-user folder pointing to a per-machine, protected directory. Windows Installer, when executing the per-machine installer after approval by an administrator, would delete the target of the directory junction. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5."], "published": "2024-03-24T20:15:08.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wixtoolset"], "productName": ["issues"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-jx4p-m4wm-vvjg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix/commit/2e5960b575881567a8807e6b8b9c513138b19742", "https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/commit/93eeb5f6835776694021f66d4226c262c67d487a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C#": 10420856, "C++": 4799874, "C": 448308, "HTML": 118940, "Batchfile": 14142, "CSS": 13248, "JavaScript": 11448, "Makefile": 10738, "Roff": 8583, "VBScript": 2888, "TSQL": 784}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91997072?v=4", "stargazers": 2256, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
