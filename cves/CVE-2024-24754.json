When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and its content added in the `$files` or `$parsedBody` arrays. The conversion process produces a different output compared to the one of plain PHP when keys ending with and open square bracket ([) are used. Based on the application logic the difference in the body parsing might lead to vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13."], "published": "2024-02-01T16:17:14.877", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["brefphp"], "productName": ["bref"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/brefphp/bref/security/advisories/GHSA-82vx-mm6r-gg8w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/brefphp/bref/commit/c77d9f5abf021f29fa96b5720b7b84adbd199092"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/brefphp/bref/security/advisories/GHSA-82vx-mm6r-gg8w", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/brefphp/bref/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aws-lambda", "bref", "faas", "lambda", "lambda-layer", "php", "serverless"], "langs": {"PHP": 327113, "JavaScript": 208515, "MDX": 123450, "TypeScript": 3428, "CSS": 2220, "Makefile": 917}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45861341?v=4", "stargazers": 3241, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
