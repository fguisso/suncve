As a result, any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these accounts. The issue has been patched in 0.6.1."], "published": "2023-02-03T20:15:11.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenZeppelin"], "productName": ["cairo-contracts"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-626q-v9j4-mcp4"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cairo", "ethereum", "security", "smart-contracts", "starknet"], "langs": {"Rust": 1582705, "Python": 2223}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20820676?v=4", "stargazers": 859, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
