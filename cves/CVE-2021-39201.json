This bypasses the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/ https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress)"], "published": "2021-09-09T22:15:09.433", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["WordPress"], "productName": ["wordpress-develop"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/security/advisories/GHSA-wh69-25hr-h94v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 31738462, "CSS": 3529811, "JavaScript": 3146509, "SCSS": 323728, "HTML": 252284, "XSLT": 2137, "Python": 1724, "Shell": 958, "Rich Text Format": 341, "Hack": 245}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/276006?v=4", "stargazers": 2715, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
