Starting in version 3.20 and prior to version 3.22, `shdr_verify_signature` can make a double free. `shdr_verify_signature` used to verify a TA binary before it is loaded. To verify a signature of it, allocate a memory for RSA key. RSA key allocate function (`sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key`) will try to allocate a memory (which is optee’s heap memory). RSA key is consist of exponent and modulus (represent as variable `e`, `n`) and it allocation is not atomic way, so it may succeed in `e` but fail in `n`. In this case sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key` will free on `e` and return as it is failed but variable ‘e’ is remained as already freed memory address . `shdr_verify_signature` will free again that memory (which is `e`) even it is freed when it failed allocate RSA key. A patch is available in version 3.22. No known workarounds are available."], "published": "2023-09-15T20:15:10.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OP-TEE"], "productName": ["optee_os"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/security/advisories/GHSA-jrw7-63cq-7vhm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/commit/e2ec831cb07ed0099535c7c140cb6338aa62816a"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/security/advisories/GHSA-jrw7-63cq-7vhm", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 21545611, "Assembly": 477292, "Makefile": 434986, "Python": 165534, "HTML": 75678, "Shell": 8935, "Linker Script": 2374}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7488961?v=4", "stargazers": 1682, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
