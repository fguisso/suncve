FlowDroid versions prior to 2.9.0 contained an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability that allowed an attacker who had control over the source/sink definition file in XML format to read files from external locations. In order for this to occur, the XML-based format for sources and sinks had to be used and the attacker had to able control the source/sink definition file. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted entities to control the source/sink definition file."], "published": "2021-07-12T23:15:07.893", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["secure-software-engineering"], "productName": ["FlowDroid"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid/security/advisories/GHSA-39r7-275f-rvgw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-flow-tracker", "flowdroid", "static-analysis"], "langs": {"Java": 4442299}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2361975?v=4", "stargazers": 1105, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
