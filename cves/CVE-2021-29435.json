A vulnerability in trestle-auth versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 allows an attacker to create a form that will bypass Rails' built-in CSRF protection when submitted by a victim with a trestle-auth admin session. This potentially allows an attacker to alter protected data, including admin account credentials. The vulnerability has been fixed in trestle-auth 0.4.2 released to RubyGems."], "published": "2021-04-13T20:15:21.907", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["TrestleAdmin"], "productName": ["trestle-auth"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-h8hx-2c5r-32cf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth/commit/cb95b05cdb2609052207af07b4b8dfe3a23c11dc"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 94838, "HTML": 19105, "SCSS": 3073, "JavaScript": 2523, "CSS": 1232}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29348992?v=4", "stargazers": 54, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
