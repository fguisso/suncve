Arbitrary file access can occur via custom QCOW2 external data. By supplying a crafted QCOW2 image that references a specific data file path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy of that file's contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. All Cinder and Nova deployments are affected; only Glance deployments with image conversion enabled are affected."], "published": "2024-07-05T02:15:09.840", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
