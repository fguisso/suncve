Starting in version 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0, a user with access to the backoffice can upload SVG files that include scripts. If the user can trick another user to load the media directly in a browser, the scripts can be executed. Versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0 contain a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Implement the server side file validation or serve all media from an different host (e.g cdn) than where Umbraco is hosted."], "published": "2023-12-12T20:15:08.390", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["umbraco"], "productName": ["Umbraco-CMS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-6xmx-85x3-4cv2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asp-net-core", "cms", "csharp", "dotnet-core", "hacktoberfest", "umbraco", "umbraco-cms"], "langs": {"C#": 19789884, "TypeScript": 11686920, "JavaScript": 103162, "HTML": 62862, "CSS": 20178, "MDX": 12163, "Dockerfile": 2714, "Shell": 1652, "TSQL": 159}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419552?v=4", "stargazers": 4807, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
