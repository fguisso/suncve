The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `optimize_sqltuningadvisor` method of `sql_optimize.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in `sql_optimize.py` is passed to the `sqltuningadvisor` method in `oracle.py`for execution.
