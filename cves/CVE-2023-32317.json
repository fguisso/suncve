A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the MOSS cheat checker functionality of Autolab. To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Both \"Base File Tar\" and \"Additional file archive\" can be fed with Tar files that contain paths outside their target directories (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped2.sh`). When the MOSS cheat checker is started the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write within the scope of the running process.  This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade."], "published": "2023-05-26T23:15:16.950", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["autolab"], "productName": ["Autolab"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-h8g5-vhm4-wx6g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/commit/410a9228ee265f80692334d75eb2c3b4dac6f9e5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["autograding", "autolab", "cmu", "education", "feedback", "programming", "rails", "scoreboard", "students", "teaching"], "langs": {"Ruby": 992209, "HTML": 371478, "JavaScript": 287494, "Java": 261126, "SCSS": 113948, "CSS": 16907, "Shell": 10622, "Dockerfile": 1584, "CoffeeScript": 211, "Python": 34}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2337016?v=4", "stargazers": 785, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
