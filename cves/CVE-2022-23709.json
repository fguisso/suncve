However, any new or modified rules would not be enabled, and a user with this privilege could not modify alerting connectors. This effectively means that Read users could disable existing alerting rules."], "published": "2022-03-03T22:15:08.850", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Elastic"], "productName": ["kibana"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
