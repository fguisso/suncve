Prior to 0.6.0, the project's provided HTTP client's local JWK Set cache should do a full replacement when the goroutine refreshes the remote JWK Set. The current behavior is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0. The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation. This involves setting the HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval to zero (or not specifying the value)."], "published": "2025-01-09T18:15:30.233", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MicahParks"], "productName": ["jwkset"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/security/advisories/GHSA-675f-rq2r-jw82"], "commits": ["https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/commit/01db49a90f7f20c7fb39a699a2f19a7a5f379ed3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["go", "golang", "jwk", "jwks", "jwks-endpoint", "jwks-rsa", "jwkset", "rfc7517"], "langs": {"Go": 189213, "JavaScript": 16901, "Shell": 1112, "Dockerfile": 348, "CSS": 59}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66095735?v=4", "stargazers": 48, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
