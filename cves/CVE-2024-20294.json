An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface of an affected device and having an authenticated user retrieve LLDP statistics from the affected device through CLI show commands or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the LLDP service to crash and stop running on the affected device. In certain situations, the LLDP crash may result in a reload of the affected device.\r\n\r Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 link protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be directly connected to an interface of an affected device, either physically or logically (for example, through a Layer 2 Tunnel configured to transport the LLDP protocol)."], "published": "2024-02-29T01:43:59.207", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software", "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)", "Cisco Firepower Extensible Operating System (FXOS)", "Cisco NX-OS System Software in ACI Mode"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
