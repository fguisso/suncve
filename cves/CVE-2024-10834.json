The issue arises from the ability to pass an absolute path to a call to `os.path.join`, enabling an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the target server. This vulnerability can be exploited by setting the `doc_file.filename` to an absolute path, which can lead to overwriting system files or creating new SSH-key entries."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:20.753", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["eosphoros-ai"], "productName": ["eosphoros-ai/db-gpt"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
