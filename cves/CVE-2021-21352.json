In TimeTracker before version 1.19.24.5415 tokens used in password reset feature in Time Tracker are based on system time and, therefore, are predictable. This opens a window for brute force attacks to guess user tokens and, once successful, change user passwords, including that of a system administrator. This vulnerability is pathced in version 1.19.24.5415 (started to use more secure tokens) with an additional improvement in 1.19.24.5416 (limited an available window for brute force token guessing)."], "published": "2021-03-03T01:15:13.427", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["anuko"], "productName": ["timetracker"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-43c9-rx4h-4gqq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/40f3d9345adc20e6f28eb9f59e2489aff87fecf5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 5951736, "Smarty": 314330, "JavaScript": 30090, "CSS": 16132, "Batchfile": 13672, "Shell": 2274}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2672997?v=4", "stargazers": 192, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
