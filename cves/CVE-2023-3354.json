When a client connects to the VNC server, QEMU checks whether the current number of connections crosses a certain threshold and if so, cleans up the previous connection. If the previous connection happens to be in the handshake phase and fails, QEMU cleans up the connection again, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference issue. This could allow a remote unauthenticated client to cause a denial of service."], "published": "2023-07-11T17:15:13.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a", "Red Hat", "Fedora"], "productName": ["qemu", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Advanced Virtualization", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 (Queens)", "Fedora", "Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
