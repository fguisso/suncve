The vulnerability CVE-2023-49090 wasn't fully addressed. This vulnerability is caused by the fact that when uploading to object storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to set a Content-Type value that is interpreted by browsers to be different from what's allowed by `content_type_allowlist`, by providing multiple values separated by commas. This bypassed value can be used to cause XSS. Upgrade to 3.0.7 or 2.2.6.\n"], "published": "2024-03-24T20:15:07.770", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["carrierwaveuploader"], "productName": ["carrierwave"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-vfmv-jfc5-pjjw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/25b1c800d45ef8e78dc445ebe3bd8a6e3f0a3477"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 601718, "Gherkin": 30231, "HTML": 1517}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3982589?v=4", "stargazers": 8783, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
