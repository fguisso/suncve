The interrupt handler itself is guaranteed that\ntrigger is always valid between request_irq() and free_irq(), but\nthe loopback testing mechanisms to invoke the handler function\nneed to test the trigger.  The triggering and setting ioctl paths\nboth make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.\n\nThe vfio-fsl-mc driver does not make use of irqfds, nor does it\nsupport any sort of masking operations, therefore unlike vfio-pci\nand vfio-platform, the flow can remain essentially unchanged."], "published": "2024-04-05T09:15:09.393", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
