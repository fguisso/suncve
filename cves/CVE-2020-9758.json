A blind JavaScript injection lies in the name parameter. Triggering this can fetch the username and passwords of the helpdesk employees in the URI. This leads to a privilege escalation, from unauthenticated to user-level access, leading to full account takeover. The attack fetches multiple credentials because they are stored in the database (stored XSS). This affects the mobile/chat URI via the lgn and psswrd parameters."], "published": "2020-03-09T19:15:15.880", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/ari034/CVE-2020-9758", "https://github.com/ari034/CVE-2020-9758"]}
