Prior to version 2.7.5, all users of the `run-terraform` reusable workflow from the kartverket/github-workflows repo are affected by a code injection vulnerability. A malicious actor could potentially send a PR with a malicious payload leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the workflow. Users should upgrade to at least version 2.7.5 to resolve the issue. As a workaround, review any pull requests from external users for malicious payloads before allowing them to trigger a build."], "published": "2022-10-25T17:15:56.087", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kartverket"], "productName": ["github-workflows"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-f9qj-7gh3-mhj4"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2970101?v=4", "stargazers": 5, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
