SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords) as a secondary authentication factor. Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes. These are a set of one time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP. In SFTPGo versions from version 2.2.0 to 2.3.3 recovery codes can be generated before enabling two-factor authentication. An attacker who knows the user's password could potentially generate some recovery codes and then bypass two-factor authentication after it is enabled on the account at a later time. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.4. Recovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-factor authentication and are deleted after disabling it."], "published": "2022-09-02T18:15:12.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["drakkan"], "productName": ["sftpgo"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/security/advisories/GHSA-54qx-8p8w-xhg8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["azure-blob", "cloud-storage", "data-at-rest-encryption", "docker", "ftp", "ftp-server", "git", "go", "google-cloud-storage", "multi-factor-authentication", "portable", "prometheus", "proxy-protocol", "s3", "scp", "sftp", "sftp-server", "webdav", "webdav-server"], "langs": {"Go": 5967435, "HTML": 1002700, "Shell": 8480, "Inno Setup": 5460, "Dockerfile": 2719, "JavaScript": 2387, "PowerShell": 1982, "CSS": 202, "Makefile": 157}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/553263?v=4", "stargazers": 10205, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
