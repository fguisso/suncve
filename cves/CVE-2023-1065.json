It does not expose the user of the integration to any direct security risk and no user data can be leaked. To exploit the vulnerability the attacker does not need to be authenticated to Snyk but does need to know the target's Integration ID (which may or may not be the same as the Organization ID, although this is an unpredictable UUID in either case)."], "published": "2023-02-28T19:15:16.727", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Snyk"], "productName": ["Snyk Kubernetes Monitor"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/snyk/kubernetes-monitor/commit/5b9a7821680bbfb6c4a900ab05d898ce2b2cc157"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/snyk/kubernetes-monitor/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 314881, "Shell": 9647, "Dockerfile": 3222, "Mustache": 811, "JavaScript": 637, "Starlark": 619}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959162?v=4", "stargazers": 90, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
