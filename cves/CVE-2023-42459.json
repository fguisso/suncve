In affected versions specific DATA submessages can be sent to a discovery locator which may trigger a free error. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. The call to free() could potentially leave the pointer in the attackers control which could lead to a double free. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"], "published": "2023-10-16T21:15:10.923", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["eProsima"], "productName": ["Fast-DDS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-gq8g-fj58-22gm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-gq8g-fj58-22gm", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cpp", "dds", "fastdds", "middleware", "omg", "robotics", "ros2", "rtps"], "langs": {"C++": 47388003, "C": 9849654, "CMake": 590230, "Python": 298645, "CSS": 28054, "Shell": 13986, "Makefile": 5345, "HTML": 2698, "Dockerfile": 1683, "Batchfile": 1395, "PowerShell": 954}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6390783?v=4", "stargazers": 2363, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
