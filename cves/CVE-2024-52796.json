In versions prior to v1.49.0, the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site potentially causing a denial of service. In v1.49.0, a fix was implemented to only authorize proxies on local IPs which resolves this issue. As a workaround, one may add rules to one's proxy and/or firewall to not accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*` from clients."], "published": "2024-11-20T17:15:20.953", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pglombardo"], "productName": ["PasswordPusher"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/security/advisories/GHSA-ffp2-8p2h-4m5j"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["communicate-passwords", "docker-container", "encryption", "hacktoberfest", "information-technology", "netsec", "netsec-tools", "openshift-templates", "password", "password-expiration", "password-pusher", "password-safety", "ruby", "secret", "security", "security-tools", "self-hosted"], "langs": {"Ruby": 439919, "HTML": 172868, "JavaScript": 26216, "Shell": 4127, "Dockerfile": 3568, "Smarty": 1752, "CSS": 590, "SCSS": 408, "Procfile": 156}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/395132?v=4", "stargazers": 2339, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
