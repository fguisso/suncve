In OAuth2 Proxy before version 7.0.0, for users that use the whitelist domain feature, a domain that ended in a similar way to the intended domain could have been allowed as a redirect. For example, if a whitelist domain was configured for \".example.com\", the intention is that subdomains of example.com are allowed. Instead, \"example.com\" and \"badexample.com\" could also match. This is fixed in version 7.0.0 onwards. As a workaround, one can disable the whitelist domain feature and run separate OAuth2 Proxy instances for each subdomain."], "published": "2021-02-02T19:15:14.330", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["oauth2-proxy"], "productName": ["oauth2-proxy"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-4mf2-f3wh-gvf2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/commit/780ae4f3c99b579cb2ea9845121caebb6192f725"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-4mf2-f3wh-gvf2", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-infrastructure", "hacktoberfest", "oauth2-proxy", "ssl", "sso"], "langs": {"Go": 1302118, "Makefile": 9710, "HTML": 6863, "Shell": 3610, "Dockerfile": 3410}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62798169?v=4", "stargazers": 10812, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
