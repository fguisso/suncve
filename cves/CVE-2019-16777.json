It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a serve binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a serve binary would overwrite the previous serve binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option."], "published": "2019-12-13T01:15:11.007", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["npm"], "productName": ["cli"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/npm/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-4328-8hgf-7wjr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/npm/cli/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "nodejs", "npm", "npm-cli", "package-manager", "tools"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 13524925, "Handlebars": 25834, "Shell": 10986, "PowerShell": 1526, "Batchfile": 1180}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6078720?v=4", "stargazers": 8794, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
