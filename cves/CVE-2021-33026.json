If an attacker gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can construct a crafted payload, poison the cache, and execute Python code. NOTE: a third party indicates that exploitation is extremely unlikely unless the machine is already compromised; in other cases, the attacker would be unable to write their payload to the cache and generate the required collision."], "published": "2021-05-13T23:15:07.367", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/CarlosG13/CVE-2021-33026", "https://github.com/Agilevatester/FlaskCache_CVE-2021-33026_POC", "https://github.com/CarlosG13/CVE-2021-33026", "https://github.com/Agilevatester/FlaskCache_CVE-2021-33026_POC"]}
