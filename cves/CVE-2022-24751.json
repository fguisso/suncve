Starting with version 4.0 and prior to version 4.11, Zulip is vulnerable to a race condition during account deactivation, where a simultaneous access by the user being deactivated may, in rare cases, allow continued access by the deactivated user. A patch is available in version 4.11 on the 4.x branch and version 5.0-rc1 on the 5.x branch. Upgrading to a fixed version will, as a side effect, deactivate any cached sessions that may have been leaked through this bug. There are currently no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-03-16T14:15:08.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["zulip"], "productName": ["zulip"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-6v98-m5x5-phqj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/62ba8e455d8f460001d9fb486a6dabfd1ed67717", "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/e6eace307ef435eec3395c99247155efed9219e4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["apache", "chat", "collaboration", "electron", "foss", "free", "javascript", "python", "python3", "react-native", "slack", "zulip"], "langs": {"Python": 14732576, "TypeScript": 4361202, "JavaScript": 2407346, "CSS": 986884, "HTML": 984922, "Handlebars": 647787, "Shell": 166116, "Puppet": 141401, "Perl": 10353, "Dockerfile": 4219, "Ruby": 3794, "Emacs Lisp": 157}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4921959?v=4", "stargazers": 22600, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
