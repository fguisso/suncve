This is due to the plugin not preventing direct access to several test files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website. This plugin is no longer being maintained and has been closed for downloads."], "published": "2024-07-13T06:15:05.587", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stijnvanderree"], "productName": ["Laposta"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
