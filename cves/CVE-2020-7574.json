The code could be potentially executed later by another (possibly privileged) user. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of other users' web session."], "published": "2020-04-14T20:15:15.480", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Siemens"], "productName": ["Climatix POL908 (BACnet/IP module)", "Climatix POL909 (AWM module)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
