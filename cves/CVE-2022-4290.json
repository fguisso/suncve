This potentially allows authenticated users with the ability to add or modify terms or tags to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. A partial patch became available in version 3.6 and the issue was fully patched in version 3.7."], "published": "2023-10-20T08:15:11.917", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["karevn"], "productName": ["Cyr to Lat enhanced"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
