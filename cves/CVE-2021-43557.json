The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains \"^/internal/\", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin."], "published": "2021-11-22T09:15:07.627", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache APISIX"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/xvnpw/k8s-CVE-2021-43557-poc", "https://github.com/xvnpw/k8s-CVE-2021-43557-poc"]}
