In versions 0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba."], "published": "2023-02-17T23:15:12.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["moby"], "productName": ["hyperkit"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/commit/af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 1409294, "Go": 41632, "OCaml": 15978, "Makefile": 11165, "Roff": 11161, "DTrace": 9977, "Shell": 4615}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27259197?v=4", "stargazers": 3644, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
