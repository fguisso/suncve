To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be first authenticated to the application. For the first one, the attacker has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field of a shared item. For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload within its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed."], "published": "2017-11-27T19:29:00.220", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/commit/5f16f6bb132138ee04eb1e0debf2bdc7d7b7a15f"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["php"], "langs": {"PHP": 6473559, "CSS": 4733826, "JavaScript": 4626193, "SCSS": 248319, "Less": 238413, "HTML": 4914, "Shell": 2704, "Dockerfile": 2138}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1197546?v=4", "stargazers": 1713, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
