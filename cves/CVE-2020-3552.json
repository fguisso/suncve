The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wired client to the Ethernet interface of an affected device and sending a series of specific packets within a short time frame. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a NULL pointer access that results in a reload of the affected device."], "published": "2020-09-24T18:15:21.900", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Aironet Access Point Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
