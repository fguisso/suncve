Affected Version(s): 2.5.1.8. The Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W web interface does not use session cookies for tracking authenticated sessions. Instead, the web interface uses a \"SEID\" token that is appended to the end of URLs in GET requests. Thus the \"SEID\" would be exposed in web proxy logs and browser history. An attacker that is able to capture the \"SEID\" and originate requests from the same IP address (via a NAT device or web proxy) would be able to access the user interface of the device without having to know the credentials."], "published": "2020-11-24T19:15:10.823", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
