A data leakage flaw was found in ImageSharp's JPEG and TGA decoders. This vulnerability is triggered when an attacker passes a specially crafted JPEG or TGA image file to a software using ImageSharp, potentially disclosing sensitive information from other parts of the software in the resulting image buffer.
