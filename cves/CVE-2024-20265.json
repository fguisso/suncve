An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by interrupting the boot process and executing specific commands to bypass the Cisco Secure Boot validation checks and load an image that has been tampered with. This image would have been previously downloaded onto the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to load the image once. The Cisco Secure Boot functionality is not permanently compromised."], "published": "2024-03-27T17:15:51.113", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XE Software", "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software", "Cisco Business Wireless Access Point Software", "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software (IOS XE Controller)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
