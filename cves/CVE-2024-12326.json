This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and preventing the browser preview for MIME type image/svg+xml. This issue was first reported in CVE-2022-30110. However, it was still possible to do a browser preview of a SVG file by sending a manipulated MIME type during the upload, where the case of any letter in image/svg+xml had been changed (like image/svg+XML). The check for image/svg+xml has been changed to be case insensitive."], "published": "2024-12-06T21:15:05.957", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Jirafeau project"], "productName": ["Jirafeau"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
