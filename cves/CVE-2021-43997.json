FreeRTOS versions through 10.4.6 do not prevent a third party that has already independently gained the ability to execute injected code to achieve further privilege escalation by branching directly inside a FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper function with a manually crafted stack frame. These issues affect ARMv7-M MPU ports, and ARMv8-M ports with MPU support enabled (i.e. configENABLE_MPU set to 1). These are fixed in V10.5.0 and in V10.4.3-LTS Patch 3."], "published": "2021-11-17T21:15:07.780", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
