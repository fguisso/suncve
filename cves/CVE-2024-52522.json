Insecure handling of symlinks with --links and --metadata in rclone while copying to local disk allows unprivileged users to indirectly modify ownership and permissions on symlink target files when a superuser or privileged process performs a copy. This vulnerability could enable privilege escalation and unauthorized access to critical system files, compromising system integrity, confidentiality, and availability. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.68.2."], "published": "2024-11-15T18:15:30.643", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rclone"], "productName": ["rclone"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rclone/rclone/security/advisories/GHSA-hrxh-9w67-g4cv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/01ccf204f42b4f68541b16843292439090a2dcf0"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/rclone/rclone/security/advisories/GHSA-hrxh-9w67-g4cv", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/rclone/rclone/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["azure-blob", "azure-blob-storage", "azure-files", "backblaze-b2", "cloud-storage", "dropbox", "encryption", "ftp", "fuse-filesystem", "go", "golang", "google-cloud-storage", "google-drive", "onedrive", "openstack-swift", "rclone", "s3", "sftp", "sync", "webdav"], "langs": {"Go": 7669268, "Python": 36965, "Shell": 35440, "HTML": 34707, "JavaScript": 21079, "Makefile": 11900, "Dockerfile": 3556, "C": 3283, "PHP": 2519, "Batchfile": 616}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24937341?v=4", "stargazers": 49679, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
