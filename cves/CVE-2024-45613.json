Starting in version 40.0.0 and prior to version 43.1.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration. This vulnerability only affects installations where the Block Toolbar plugin is enabled and either the General HTML Support (with a configuration that permits unsafe markup) or the HTML Embed plugin is also enabled. A fix for the problem is available in version 43.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the block toolbar plugin."], "published": "2024-09-25T14:15:05.303", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ckeditor"], "productName": ["ckeditor5"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ckeditor", "ckeditor5", "contenteditable", "javascript", "rich-text-editor", "rte", "wysiwyg", "wysiwyg-editor"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 16460605, "Rich Text Format": 14464914, "TypeScript": 6995813, "HTML": 5077478, "CSS": 286698, "Shell": 2367}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825710?v=4", "stargazers": 9996, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
