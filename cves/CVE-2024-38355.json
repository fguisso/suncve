A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This issue is fixed by commit `15af22fc22` which has been included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023). The fix was backported in the 2.x branch as well with commit `d30630ba10`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attach a listener for the \"error\" event to catch these errors.\n"], "published": "2024-06-19T20:15:11.180", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["socketio"], "productName": ["socket.io"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/security/advisories/GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/15af22fc22bc6030fcead322c106f07640336115", "https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/d30630ba10562bf987f4d2b42440fc41a828119c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "nodejs", "socket-io", "websocket"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 735272, "JavaScript": 441182, "Shell": 1229, "HTML": 372, "CSS": 183}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10566080?v=4", "stargazers": 61878, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
