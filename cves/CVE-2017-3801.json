The vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) after the Developer Menu is enabled in Cisco UCS Director. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enabling Developer Mode for his/her user profile with an end-user profile and then adding new catalogs with arbitrary workflow items to his/her profile. An exploit could allow an attacker to perform any actions defined by these workflow items, including actions affecting other tenants.
