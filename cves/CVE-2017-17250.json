When a user executes a query command after the device received an abnormal OSPF message, the software writes data past the end of the intended buffer due to the insufficient verification of the input data. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending abnormal OSPF messages to the device. A successful exploit could cause the system to crash."], "published": "2018-03-09T17:29:01.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd."], "productName": ["AR120-S; AR1200; AR1200-S; AR150; AR150-S; AR160; AR200; AR200-S; AR2200-S; AR3200; AR510; NetEngine16EX; SRG1300; SRG2300; SRG3300"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
