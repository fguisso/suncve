The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. The phpMyFAQ application has a functionality where anyone can share a FAQ item to others. The front-end of this functionality allows any phpMyFAQ articles to be shared with 5 email addresses. Any unauthenticated actor can perform this action. There is a CAPTCHA in place, however the amount of people you email with a single request is not limited to 5 by the backend. An attacker can thus solve a single CAPTCHA and send thousands of emails at once. An attacker can utilize the target application's email server to send phishing messages. This can get the server on a blacklist, causing all emails to end up in spam. It can also lead to reputation damages. This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5."], "published": "2024-02-05T21:15:11.830", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["thorsten"], "productName": ["phpMyFAQ"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-9hhf-xmcw-r3xg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/a34d94ab7b1be9256a9ef898f18ea6bfb63f6f1e"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-9hhf-xmcw-r3xg", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["database", "docker", "docker-compose", "elasticsearch", "faq", "mariadb", "mssql", "mysql", "php", "phpmyfaq", "postgresql", "sqlite"], "langs": {"PHP": 9668644, "TypeScript": 475631, "Twig": 353607, "SCSS": 19887, "Shell": 12043, "Dockerfile": 6747, "JavaScript": 3002, "CSS": 1125, "HTML": 205}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45284?v=4", "stargazers": 596, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
