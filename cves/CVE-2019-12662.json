The vulnerability is due to improper signature verification during the installation of an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) image. An authenticated, local attacker could exploit this vulnerability and load a malicious, unsigned OVA image on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to perform code execution on a crafted software OVA image."], "published": "2019-09-25T21:15:11.203", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software 6.0(2)A1(1)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
