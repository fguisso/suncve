In affected versions an attacker can read arbitrary local files via a PHP file include. In a default configuration this also leads to remote code execution. The problem is patched with the Versions 1.6.44, 2.2.18, 2.3.8, 2.4.0. For users unable to upgrade overwrite the service `sulu_route.generator.expression_token_provider` and wrap the translator before passing it to the expression language."], "published": "2021-12-15T20:15:08.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sulu"], "productName": ["sulu"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sulu/sulu/security/advisories/GHSA-vx6j-pjrh-vgjh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/sulu/sulu/commit/9c948f9ce350c68b53af8c3910e2cefc7f722b54"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sulu/sulu/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admin", "cmf", "cms", "hacktoberfest", "php", "sulu", "symfony"], "langs": {"PHP": 11234993, "JavaScript": 4906065, "SCSS": 169183, "Twig": 47211, "CSS": 9960, "VCL": 4428, "Shell": 158}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5717006?v=4", "stargazers": 1215, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
