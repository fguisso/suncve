Versions prior to 48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d are affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. A large amount of page moves within a short space of time could overwhelm Database servers due to improper handling of load balancing and a lack of an appropriate index. As a workaround, one may avoid use of the extension unless additional rate limit at the MediaWiki level or via PoolCounter / MySQL is enabled. A patch is available in version 48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d."], "published": "2021-06-28T20:15:07.773", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["miraheze"], "productName": ["GlobalNewFiles"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/miraheze/GlobalNewFiles/security/advisories/GHSA-cwv5-c938-5h5h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/miraheze/GlobalNewFiles/commit/48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/miraheze/GlobalNewFiles/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["mediawiki-extension"], "langs": {"PHP": 15141, "CSS": 49}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13278007?v=4", "stargazers": 1, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
