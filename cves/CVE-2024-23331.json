The Vite dev server option `server.fs.deny` can be bypassed on case-insensitive file systems using case-augmented versions of filenames. Notably this affects servers hosted on Windows. This bypass is similar to CVE-2023-34092 -- with surface area reduced to hosts having case-insensitive filesystems. Since `picomatch` defaults to case-sensitive glob matching, but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist bypass is possible. By requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented casing, the matcher derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to block access to sensitive files. This issue has been addressed in vite@5.0.12, vite@4.5.2, vite@3.2.8, and vite@2.9.17. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to dev servers."], "published": "2024-01-19T20:15:14.070", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vitejs"], "productName": ["vite"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-c24v-8rfc-w8vw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/91641c4da0a011d4c5352e88fc68389d4e1289a5"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-c24v-8rfc-w8vw", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["build-tool", "dev-server", "frontend", "hmr", "vite"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2057051, "JavaScript": 243555, "HTML": 124480, "CSS": 30519, "Vue": 3535, "AppleScript": 2691, "Svelte": 2510, "SCSS": 1894, "Less": 1079, "Stylus": 531, "SugarSS": 274, "Shell": 244, "Pug": 165, "Sass": 140, "Astro": 114}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65625612?v=4", "stargazers": 71914, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
