In versions prior to 1.3.35, read only calls between contracts can generate smart contracts results. For example, if contract A calls in read only mode contract B and the called function will make changes upon the contract's B state, the state will be altered for contract B as if the call was not made in the read-only mode. This can lead to some effects not designed by the original smart contracts programmers. This issue was patched in version 1.3.35. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-09-06T21:15:08.633", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ElrondNetwork"], "productName": ["elrond-go"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/security/advisories/GHSA-mv8x-668m-53fg"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blockchain", "cryptocurrency", "decentralized", "go", "golang", "multiversx", "p2p"], "langs": {"Go": 20060841, "Shell": 82189, "Makefile": 3207, "Dockerfile": 3107}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114073177?v=4", "stargazers": 939, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
