This includes the possibility to fetch typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php, which again contains the encryptionKey as well as credentials of the database management system being used. In case a database server is directly accessible either via internet or in a shared hosting network, this allows the ability to completely retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents. This includes creating an administration user account - which can be used to trigger remote code execution by injecting custom extensions. This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6."], "published": "2020-07-29T17:15:13.497", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["TYPO3"], "productName": ["TYPO3 CMS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-3x94-fv5h-5q2c"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "content-management", "enterprise", "php", "typo3"], "langs": {"PHP": 34836536, "TypeScript": 2559502, "HTML": 1956714, "CSS": 587310, "SCSS": 471817, "JavaScript": 217512, "Shell": 94459, "XSLT": 6781, "Batchfile": 412}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88698?v=4", "stargazers": 1099, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
