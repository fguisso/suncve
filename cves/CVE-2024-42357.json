Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, the Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the `aggregations` object. The `name` field in this `aggregations` object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using SQL parameters. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin."], "published": "2024-08-08T15:15:18.460", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["shopware"], "productName": ["shopware"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-p6w9-r443-r752"], "commits": ["https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/63c05615694790f5790a04ef889f42b764fa53c9", "https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/a784aa1cec0624e36e0ee4d41aeebaed40e0442f", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/57ea2f3c59483cf7c0f853e7a0d68c23ded1fe5b", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/8504ba7e56e53add6a1d5b9d45015e3d899cd0ac"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api-first-cms", "apifirst", "digital-commerce", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-platform", "experience-commerce", "experience-manager", "hacktoberfest", "headless-cms", "magento", "online-shop", "online-store", "php", "prestashop", "shop", "shopping-cart", "shopware", "storefront", "symfony", "vuejs"], "langs": {"PHP": 33148885, "JavaScript": 12681381, "Twig": 4772824, "TypeScript": 2041509, "SCSS": 1023689, "CSS": 135217, "Vue": 32138, "Shell": 30355, "HTML": 27250, "Nix": 4870, "Groovy": 3900, "Smarty": 1174}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/612628?v=4", "stargazers": 2998, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
