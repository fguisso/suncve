If you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger security-sensitive functionality, you are not impacted by this vulnerability. Any dependencies that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviors (optimizations, security or otherwise) should still respect your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application's dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2, regression tests have been added for this vulnerability in #8063."], "published": "2022-11-03T14:15:23.767", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["keystonejs"], "productName": ["keystone"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-25mx-2mxm-6343"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "cms-framework", "graphql", "keystonejs", "nodejs", "react"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2216799, "JavaScript": 21500, "HTML": 5178}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6118534?v=4", "stargazers": 9496, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
