The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) function of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CSR in the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with administrator privileges to execute arbitrary commands on the device with full root privileges."], "published": "2019-08-21T19:15:15.013", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Software (UCSE) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
