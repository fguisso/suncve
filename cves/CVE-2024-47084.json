This vulnerability is related to **CORS origin validation**, where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attackerâ€™s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually enforce stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically, they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation."], "published": "2024-10-10T22:15:10.263", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gradio-app"], "productName": ["gradio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-3c67-5hwx-f6wx"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-analysis", "data-science", "data-visualization", "deep-learning", "deploy", "gradio", "gradio-interface", "hacktoberfest", "interface", "machine-learning", "models", "python", "python-notebook", "ui", "ui-components"], "langs": {"Python": 3243620, "Svelte": 1268769, "TypeScript": 1046794, "mdsvex": 217599, "CSS": 72732, "JavaScript": 62299, "Jupyter Notebook": 32113, "HTML": 22988, "Batchfile": 6427, "Shell": 6015, "MDX": 1670, "Dockerfile": 128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51063788?v=4", "stargazers": 37296, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
