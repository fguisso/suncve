However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn't same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact.\n\n\nCloudStack admins may also disallow listAnnotations and addAnnotation API access to non-admin roles in their environment as an interim measure."], "published": "2025-01-13T13:16:12.233", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache CloudStack"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Stolichnayer/CVE-2025-22828", "https://github.com/Stolichnayer/CVE-2025-22828"]}
