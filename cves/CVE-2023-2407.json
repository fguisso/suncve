This is due to missing nonce validation in the ls_parse_vcita_callback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."], "published": "2023-06-03T05:15:09.780", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vcita"], "productName": ["Event Registration Calendar By vcita", "Online Payments – Get Paid with PayPal, Square & Stripe"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
