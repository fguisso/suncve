Prior to version 1.8.0, the Faktory web dashboard can suffer from denial of service by a crafted malicious url query param `days`. The vulnerability is related to how the backend reads the `days` URL query parameter in the Faktory web dashboard. The value is used directly without any checks to create a string slice. If a very large value is provided, the backend server ends up using a significant amount of memory and causing it to crash. Version 1.8.0 fixes this issue."], "published": "2023-09-20T22:15:13.093", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["contribsys"], "productName": ["faktory"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/security/advisories/GHSA-x4hh-vjm7-g2jv"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/security/advisories/GHSA-x4hh-vjm7-g2jv", "kw": ["poc", "steps:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 370552, "CSS": 41659, "Makefile": 8700, "Ruby": 7548, "Shell": 5129, "Dockerfile": 528}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8095822?v=4", "stargazers": 5850, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
