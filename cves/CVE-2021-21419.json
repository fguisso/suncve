As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process."], "published": "2021-05-07T15:15:07.407", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["eventlet"], "productName": ["eventlet"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/security/advisories/GHSA-9p9m-jm8w-94p2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c10k", "concurrency", "greenlet", "network", "production-ready", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 1271020, "Thrift": 2121, "Shell": 1845}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3017635?v=4", "stargazers": 1246, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
