Prior to Pi-hole Web interface version 5.5.1, the function to add domains to blocklists or allowlists is vulnerable to a stored cross-site-scripting vulnerability. User input added as a wildcard domain to a blocklist or allowlist is unfiltered in the web interface. Since the payload is stored permanently as a wildcard domain, this is a persistent XSS vulnerability. A remote attacker can therefore attack administrative user accounts through client-side attacks. Pi-hole Web Interface version 5.5.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability."], "published": "2021-08-04T18:15:09.557", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pi-hole"], "productName": ["AdminLTE"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/security/advisories/GHSA-g3w6-q4fg-p8x8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admin", "dashboard", "pi-hole"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 299833, "CSS": 286052, "Answer Set Programming": 189548, "Dockerfile": 128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16827203?v=4", "stargazers": 2203, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
