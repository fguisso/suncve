An attacker can exploit the Ansible playbook to write arbitrary files, leading to remote code execution (RCE) in the Celery container. The Celery container runs as root and has database access, allowing an attacker to steal all secrets for hosts, create a new JumpServer account with admin privileges, or manipulate the database in other ways. This issue has been patched in release versions 3.10.12 and 4.0.0. It is recommended to upgrade the safe versions. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-07-18T17:15:04.613", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jumpserver"], "productName": ["jumpserver"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-3wgp-q8m7-v33v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-3wgp-q8m7-v33v", "kw": ["steps:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bastion-host", "cyberark", "django", "jumpserver", "pam", "python", "ssh-server", "teleport", "terminal"], "langs": {"Python": 4153942, "CSS": 222989, "Shell": 9821, "Go": 6879, "Java": 3754, "Dockerfile": 2123}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6006570?v=4", "stargazers": 26327, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
