An OOB-read vulnerability has been identified in the gst_wavparse_smpl_chunk function within gstwavparse.c. This function attempts to read 4 bytes from the data + 12 offset without checking if the size of the data buffer is sufficient. If the buffer is too small, the function reads beyond its bounds. This vulnerability may result in reading 4 bytes out of the boundaries of the data buffer. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:40.700", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
