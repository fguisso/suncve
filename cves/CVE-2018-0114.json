The vulnerability is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key (JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a JWS. This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the original signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then signing the object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated with the public key embedded in that JWS header."], "published": "2018-01-04T06:29:00.417", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Node-jose Library"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/zi0Black/POC-CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/Logeirs/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/adityathebe/POC-CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/Eremiel/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/Starry-lord/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/scumdestroy/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/j4k0m/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/mmeza-developer/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/Pandora-research/CVE-2018-0114-Exploit", "https://github.com/amr9k8/jwt-spoof-tool", "https://github.com/z-bool/Venom-JWT", "https://github.com/zi0Black/POC-CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/Logeirs/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/adityathebe/POC-CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/Eremiel/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/Starry-lord/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/scumdestroy/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/j4k0m/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/mmeza-developer/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/Pandora-research/CVE-2018-0114-Exploit", "https://github.com/amr9k8/jwt-spoof-tool", "https://github.com/z-bool/Venom-JWT"]}
