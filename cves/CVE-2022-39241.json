As a workaround, self-hosters can use `DISCOURSE_BLOCKED_IP_BLOCKS` env var (which overrides `blocked_ip_blocks` setting) to stop webhooks from accessing private IPs."], "published": "2022-11-02T17:15:17.187", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["discourse"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-rcc5-28r3-23rr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["discourse", "ember", "forum", "javascript", "postgresql", "rails", "ruby"], "langs": {"Ruby": 20745200, "JavaScript": 11121408, "HTML": 1462583, "SCSS": 999222, "Handlebars": 128056, "Mustache": 32177, "Shell": 12314, "CSS": 2564}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 43644, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
