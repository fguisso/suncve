Due to an inefficient algorithm in libtasn1, decoding certain DER-encoded certificate data can take excessive time, leading to increased resource consumption. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send a specially crafted certificate, causing GnuTLS to become unresponsive or slow, resulting in a denial-of-service condition."], "published": "2025-02-10T16:15:37.423", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
