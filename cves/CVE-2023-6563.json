It can be triggered in environments which have millions of offline tokens (> 500,000 users with each having at least 2 saved sessions). If an attacker creates two or more user sessions and then open the \"consents\" tab of the admin User Interface, the UI attempts to load a huge number of offline client sessions leading to excessive memory and CPU consumption which could potentially crash the entire system."], "published": "2023-12-14T18:15:45.540", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9", "RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers", "Single Sign-On 7.6.6", "Red Hat Build of Keycloak"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
