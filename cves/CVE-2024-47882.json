Prior to version 3.8.3, the built-in \"Something went wrong!\" error page includes the exception message and exception traceback without escaping HTML tags, enabling injection into the page if an attacker can reliably produce an error with an attacker-influenced message. It appears that the only way to reach this code in OpenRefine itself is for an attacker to somehow convince a victim to import a malicious file, which may be difficult.  However, out-of-tree extensions may add their own calls to `respondWithErrorPage`. Version 3.8.3 has a fix for this issue."], "published": "2024-10-24T21:15:13.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenRefine"], "productName": ["OpenRefine"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-j8hp-f2mj-586g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/85594e75e7b36025f7b6a67dcd3ec253c5dff8c2"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-j8hp-f2mj-586g", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-analysis", "data-science", "data-wrangling", "datacleaning", "datacleansing", "datajournalism", "datamining", "java", "journalism", "opendata", "reconciliation", "wikidata"], "langs": {"Java": 5878611, "JavaScript": 1815365, "HTML": 681626, "CSS": 155776, "Shell": 24785, "Velocity Template Language": 12107, "Batchfile": 9794, "Python": 4899, "Inno Setup": 4581, "mIRC Script": 762, "Less": 139}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2538880?v=4", "stargazers": 11249, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
