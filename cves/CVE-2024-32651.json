There is a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Jinja2 that allows Remote Command Execution on the server host. Attackers can run any system command without any restriction and they could use a reverse shell. The impact is critical as the attacker can completely takeover the server machine. This can be reduced if changedetection is behind a login page, but this isn't required by the application (not by default and not enforced)."], "published": "2024-04-26T00:15:08.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dgtlmoon"], "productName": ["changedetection.io"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-4r7v-whpg-8rx3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-4r7v-whpg-8rx3", "kw": ["poc", "payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["back-in-stock", "change-alert", "change-detection", "change-monitoring", "changedetection", "monitoring", "notifications", "restock-monitor", "self-hosted", "url-monitor", "web-scraping", "website-change-detection", "website-change-detector", "website-change-monitor", "website-change-notification", "website-change-tracker", "website-defacement-monitoring", "website-monitor", "website-monitoring", "website-watcher"], "langs": {"Python": 921088, "HTML": 140563, "JavaScript": 103750, "CSS": 53640, "SCSS": 45103, "Shell": 8373, "Dockerfile": 2473}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275001?v=4", "stargazers": 23129, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/zcrosman/cve-2024-32651", "https://github.com/s0ck3t-s3c/CVE-2024-32651-changedetection-RCE", "https://github.com/zcrosman/cve-2024-32651", "https://github.com/s0ck3t-s3c/CVE-2024-32651-changedetection-RCE"]}
