Prior to versions 18.24.3, 20.9.3, and 21.4.3 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert12 and 20.7-cert2 of certified-asterisk, if Asterisk attempts to send a SIP request to a URI whose host portion starts with `.1` or `[.1]`, and res_resolver_unbound is loaded, Asterisk will crash with a SEGV. To receive a patch, users should upgrade to one of the following versions: 18.24.3, 20.9.3, 21.4.3, certified-18.9-cert12, certified-20.7-cert2. Two workarounds are available. Disable res_resolver_unbound by setting `noload = res_resolver_unbound.so` in modules.conf, or set `rewrite_contact = yes` on all PJSIP endpoints. NOTE: This may not be appropriate for all Asterisk configurations."], "published": "2024-09-05T18:15:05.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["asterisk"], "productName": ["asterisk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-v428-g3cw-7hv9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/42a2f4ccfa2c7062a15063e765916b3332e34cc4", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/4f01669c7c41c9184f3cce9a3cf1b2ebf6201742", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/50bf8d4d3064930d28ecf1ce3397b14574d514d2", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/7a0090325bfa9d778a39ae5f7d0a98109e4651c8", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/a15050650abf09c10a3c135fab148220cd41d3a0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asterisk", "c", "pbx", "sip", "voip"], "langs": {"C": 36729260, "Python": 359115, "Shell": 261117, "M4": 191704, "Makefile": 136302, "Perl": 111005, "Yacc": 64828, "Mustache": 26327, "Lex": 26043, "XSLT": 15366, "Vim Script": 11793, "HTML": 11310, "Roff": 10448, "JavaScript": 7906, "Tcl": 4198, "PHP": 2106, "Mako": 1730, "CSS": 1031, "Awk": 642}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2914369?v=4", "stargazers": 2482, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
