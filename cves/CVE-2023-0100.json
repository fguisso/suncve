If the host indicated in the __report parameter matched the HTTP Host header value, the report would be retrieved. However, the Host header can be tampered with on some configurations where no virtual hosts are put in place (e.g. in the default configuration of Apache Tomcat) or when the default host points to the BIRT server. This vulnerability was patched on Eclipse BIRT 4.13."], "published": "2023-03-15T15:15:09.533", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["The Eclipse Foundation"], "productName": ["Eclipse BIRT (Business Intelligence Reporting Tool)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
