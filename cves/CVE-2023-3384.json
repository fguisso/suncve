While the image labels created through Quay undergo validation both in the UI and backend by applying a regex (validation.py), the same validation is\r\nnot performed when the label comes from an image. This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry containing a script that can be executed via Cross-site scripting (XSS)."], "published": "2023-07-24T16:15:12.523", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Quay 3"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
