Canarytokens.org supports exporting the history of a Canarytoken's incidents in CSV format. The generation of these CSV files is vulnerable to a CSV Injection vulnerability. This flaw can be used by an attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken to target the Canarytoken's owner, if the owner exports the incident history to CSV and opens in a reader application such as Microsoft Excel. The impact is that this issue could lead to code execution on the machine on which the CSV file is opened. Version sha-c595a1f8 contains a fix for this issue."], "published": "2024-03-06T22:15:57.780", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["thinkst"], "productName": ["canarytokens"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/security/advisories/GHSA-fqh6-v4qp-65fv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/commit/c595a1f884b986da2ca05aa5bff9ae5f93c6a4aa"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"HTML": 1043375, "Python": 805764, "Vue": 285553, "TypeScript": 127879, "CSS": 52795, "HCL": 27078, "Shell": 26863, "C#": 26638, "JavaScript": 12819, "PowerShell": 7228, "Dockerfile": 1957, "Makefile": 1297}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13569025?v=4", "stargazers": 1825, "language": "HTML"}}, "pocList": []}
