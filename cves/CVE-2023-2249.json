This is due to the insecure use of file_get_contents without appropriate verification of the data being supplied to the function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to retrieve the contents of files like wp-config.php hosted on the system, perform a deserialization attack and possibly achieve remote code execution, and make requests to internal services."], "published": "2023-06-09T06:16:05.470", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tomdever"], "productName": ["wpForo Forum"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/ixiacom/CVE-2023-2249", "https://github.com/ixiacom/CVE-2023-2249"]}
