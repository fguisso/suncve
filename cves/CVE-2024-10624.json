The affected version is git commit 98cbcae. The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular expression `^(?:\\s*now\\s*(?:-\\s*(\\d+)\\s*([dmhs]))?)?\\s*$` to process user input. In Python's default regex engine, this regular expression can take polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP request, causing the gradio process to consume 100% CPU and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the server."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:17.880", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gradio-app"], "productName": ["gradio-app/gradio"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
