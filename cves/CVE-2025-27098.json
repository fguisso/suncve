Missing check vulnerability in the static file handler allows any client to access the files in the server's file system. When `staticFiles` is set in the `serve` settings in the configuration file, the following handler doesn't check if `absolutePath` is still under the directory provided as `staticFiles`. Users have two options to fix vulnerability; 1. Update `@graphql-mesh/cli` to a version higher than `0.82.21`, and if you use `@graphql-mesh/http`, update it to a version higher than `0.3.18` 2. Remove `staticFiles` option from the configuration, and use other solutions to serve static files."], "published": "2025-02-20T21:15:26.370", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ardatan"], "productName": ["graphql-mesh"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh/security/advisories/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["gateway", "graphql", "grpc", "grpc-gateway", "odata", "openapi", "rest-api", "soap", "swagger", "thrift"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2073507, "MDX": 357572, "Cypher": 27786, "JavaScript": 22337, "Shell": 2360, "HTML": 1512, "Thrift": 178, "CSS": 40}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20847995?v=4", "stargazers": 3378, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
