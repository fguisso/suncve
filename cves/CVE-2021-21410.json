An out-of-bounds read can be triggered by 6LoWPAN packets sent to devices running Contiki-NG 4.6 and prior. The IPv6 header decompression function (<code>uncompress_hdr_iphc</code>) does not perform proper boundary checks when reading from the packet buffer. Hence, it is possible to construct a compressed 6LoWPAN packet that will read more bytes than what is available from the packet buffer. As of time of publication, there is not a release with a patch available. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band as a workaround."], "published": "2021-06-18T21:15:07.947", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["contiki-ng"], "productName": ["contiki-ng"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-hhwj-2p59-v8p9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["6lowpan", "6lowpan-border-router", "6tisch", "contiki-ng", "iot", "rpl", "tsch", "wsn"], "langs": {"C": 13758081, "GSC": 688626, "Python": 243324, "CSS": 53122, "Shell": 53016, "Makefile": 49706, "Linker Script": 36491, "Java": 33209, "Perl": 22060, "JavaScript": 14233, "Dockerfile": 7314, "XSLT": 4947}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067801?v=4", "stargazers": 1385, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
