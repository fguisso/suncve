An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability affects all supported SNMP versions. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv2c or earlier, an attacker must know the SNMP community string that is configured on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv3, the attacker must have valid credentials for an SNMP user who is configured on the affected device."], "published": "2023-08-23T19:15:08.020", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)", "Cisco Firepower Extensible Operating System (FXOS)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
