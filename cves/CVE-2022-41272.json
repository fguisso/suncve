This allows the attacker to have full read access to user data, make limited modifications to user data, and degrade the performance of the system, leading to a high impact on confidentiality and a limited impact on the availability and integrity of the application."], "published": "2022-12-13T04:15:24.960", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["SAP"], "productName": ["NetWeaver Process Integration"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/redrays-io/CVE-2022-41272", "https://github.com/redrays-io/CVE-2022-41272"]}
