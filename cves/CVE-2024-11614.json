This issue enables an untrusted or compromised guest to crash the hypervisor's vSwitch by forging Virtio descriptors to cause out-of-bounds reads. This flaw allows an attacker with a malicious VM using a virtio driver to cause the vhost-user side to crash by sending a packet with a Tx checksum offload request and an invalid csum_start offset."], "published": "2024-12-18T09:15:06.660", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Telecommunications Update Service", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 Extended Update Support", "Fast Datapath for RHEL 7", "Fast Datapath for RHEL 8", "Fast Datapath for RHEL 9", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
