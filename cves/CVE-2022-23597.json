Element Desktop before 1.9.7 is vulnerable to a remote program execution bug with user interaction. The exploit is non-trivial and requires clicking on a malicious link, followed by another button click. To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability has never been exploited in the wild. If you are using Element Desktop < 1.9.7, we recommend upgrading at your earliest convenience. If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a file path of a binary on the victim's computer which then gets executed. Notably, the attacker does *not* have the ability to specify program arguments. However, in certain unspecified configurations, the attacker may be able to specify an URI instead of a file path which then gets handled using standard platform mechanisms. These may allow exploiting further vulnerabilities in those mechanisms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution."], "published": "2022-02-01T12:15:08.317", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-mjrg-9f8r-h3m7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/commit/89b1e39b801655e595337708d4319ba4313feafa"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["desktop", "element", "element-web", "hacktoberfest", "matrix", "matrix-chat"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 159231, "Shell": 4371, "JavaScript": 3275, "Dockerfile": 1282, "Batchfile": 279}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13446337?v=4", "stargazers": 1244, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
