An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device at a rate that exceeds a configured rate filter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to successfully bypass the rate filter. This could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device."], "published": "2024-10-23T17:15:18.703", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
