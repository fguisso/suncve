Prior to version 1.2.27, Cacti calls `compat_password_hash` when users set their password. `compat_password_hash` use `password_hash` if there is it, else use `md5`. When verifying password, it calls `compat_password_verify`. In `compat_password_verify`, `password_verify` is called if there is it, else use `md5`. `password_verify` and `password_hash` are supported on PHP < 5.5.0, following PHP manual. The vulnerability is in `compat_password_verify`. Md5-hashed user input is compared with correct password in database by `$md5 == $hash`. It is a loose comparison, not `===`. It is a type juggling vulnerability. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2024-05-14T15:38:39.517", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cacti"], "productName": ["cacti"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-37x7-mfjv-mm7m"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-37x7-mfjv-mm7m", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cacti", "cacti-community", "cacti-framework", "data-gathering", "graph", "graph-templating", "network-discovery", "php", "rrd-files", "rrdtool"], "langs": {"PHP": 7014030, "JavaScript": 2536428, "CSS": 1220532, "SCSS": 255696, "Less": 246030, "Shell": 51723, "Perl": 7357, "HTML": 5179, "Ruby": 2138}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142645?v=4", "stargazers": 1710, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
