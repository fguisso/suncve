Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device."], "published": "2022-06-22T14:15:07.877", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
