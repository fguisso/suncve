In cmd g_b, at 0x9d015714, the value for the `grp` key is copied using `strcpy` to the buffer at `$sp+0x280`.This buffer is 16 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow."], "published": "2023-01-11T22:15:09.990", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Insteon"], "productName": ["Hub"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
