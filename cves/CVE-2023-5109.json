This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This was partially patched in version 3.1.3 and fully patched in version 3.1.4."], "published": "2023-10-20T08:15:13.127", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ironikus"], "productName": ["WP Mailto Links – Protect Email Addresses"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
