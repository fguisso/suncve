Consequently, the MQTT broker, typically operated by a system integrator, will have no access to the dronesâ€™ real RID information.\n\nThis issue affects the adjacent channel suppression algorithm present in DroneScout ds230 firmware from version 20211210-1627 through 20230329-1042."], "published": "2023-07-11T09:15:09.653", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["bluemark"], "productName": ["ds230"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
