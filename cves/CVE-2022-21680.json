Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `block.def` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources."], "published": "2022-01-14T17:15:13.210", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["markedjs"], "productName": ["marked"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-rrrm-qjm4-v8hf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/c4a3ccd344b6929afa8a1d50ac54a721e57012c0"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-rrrm-qjm4-v8hf", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["commonmark", "compiler", "gfm", "hacktoberfest", "markdown", "parser"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 110564, "JavaScript": 110531, "HTML": 94597}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19886934?v=4", "stargazers": 34294, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
