This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account."], "published": "2025-02-18T05:15:17.893", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["istmoplugins"], "productName": ["GetBookingsWP – Appointments Booking Calendar Plugin For WordPress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
