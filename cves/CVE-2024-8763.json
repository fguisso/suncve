The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:43.867", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["lunary-ai"], "productName": ["lunary-ai/lunary"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/7ff89b0304d191534b924cf063f3648206d497fa"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "evaluation", "hacktoberfest", "langchain", "llm", "logs", "monitoring", "observability", "openai", "prompts", "self-hosted", "testing"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1295928, "Python": 113312, "CSS": 8883, "JavaScript": 3378, "Shell": 522}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133512303?v=4", "stargazers": 1256, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
