This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message."], "published": "2017-05-04T14:29:00.200", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/homjxi0e/CVE-2017-8295-WordPress-4.7.4---Unauthorized-Password-Reset", "https://github.com/alash3al/wp-allowed-hosts", "https://github.com/cyberheartmi9/CVE-2017-8295", "https://github.com/homjxi0e/CVE-2017-8295-WordPress-4.7.4---Unauthorized-Password-Reset", "https://github.com/alash3al/wp-allowed-hosts", "https://github.com/cyberheartmi9/CVE-2017-8295"]}
