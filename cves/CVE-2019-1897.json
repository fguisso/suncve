The vulnerability is due to improper authorization of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the URL for device disconnection and providing the connected device information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny service to specific clients that are connected to the guest network."], "published": "2019-06-20T03:15:12.353", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router Firmware "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
