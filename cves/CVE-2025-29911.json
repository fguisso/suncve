A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted AOS frame with an insufficient length. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity`, specifically during the processing of the Frame Error Control Field (FECF). The affected code attempts to read from the `p_ingest` buffer at indices `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 2` and `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 1` without verifying if `len_ingest` is sufficiently large. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when `len_ingest` is smaller than `max_frame_size`. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist."], "published": "2025-03-17T23:15:18.293", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nasa"], "productName": ["CryptoLib"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-7g6g-9gj4-8c68"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-7g6g-9gj4-8c68", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ccsds", "cfs", "communications", "data-link", "ground-station", "sdls-ep", "space-communications", "space-data-link-security-protocol", "space-network", "spack-data-link"], "langs": {"C": 2002164, "C++": 58820, "CMake": 24681, "Python": 15181, "Shell": 7065, "Dockerfile": 2622, "Makefile": 898}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848102?v=4", "stargazers": 100, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
