It is also usable outside of Rails in any Rack app as Rack middleware. better_errors prior to 2.8.0 did not implement CSRF protection for its internal requests. It also did not enforce the correct \"Content-Type\" header for these requests, which allowed a cross-origin \"simple request\" to be made without CORS protection. These together left an application with better_errors enabled open to cross-origin attacks. As a developer tool, better_errors documentation strongly recommends addition only to the `development` bundle group, so this vulnerability should only affect development environments. Please ensure that your project limits better_errors to the `development` group (or the non-Rails equivalent). Starting with release 2.8.x, CSRF protection is enforced. It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest release, or minimally to \"~> 2.8.3\". There are no known workarounds to mitigate the risk of using older releases of better_errors."], "published": "2021-09-07T18:15:07.473", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["BetterErrors"], "productName": ["better_errors"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/BetterErrors/better_errors/security/advisories/GHSA-w3j4-76qw-wwjm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/BetterErrors/better_errors/commit/8e8e796bfbde4aa088741823c8a3fc6df2089bb0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/BetterErrors/better_errors/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 106586, "SCSS": 24734, "HTML": 19540}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42681592?v=4", "stargazers": 6885, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
