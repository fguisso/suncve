When using the greader API, the provided password is logged in clear in `users/_/log_api.txt` in the case where the authentication fails. The issues occurs in `authorizationToUser()` in `greader.php`. If there is an issue with the request or the credentials, `unauthorized()` or `badRequest()` is called. Both these functions are printing the return of `debugInfo()` in the logs. `debugInfo()` will return the content of the request. By default, this will be saved in `users/_/log_api.txt` and if the const `COPY_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` is true, in syslogs as well. Exploiting this issue requires having access to logs produced by FreshRSS. Using the information from the logs, a malicious individual could get users' API keys (would be displayed if the users fills in a bad username) or passwords."], "published": "2023-03-06T18:15:10.357", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FreshRSS"], "productName": ["FreshRSS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-8vvv-jxg6-8578"], "commits": ["https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/075cf4c800063e3cc65c3d41a9c23222e8ebb554"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-8vvv-jxg6-8578", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["feed", "freshrss", "news-aggregator", "php", "rss", "rss-aggregator", "rss-reader", "self-hosted", "websub"], "langs": {"PHP": 3921971, "CSS": 465229, "HTML": 353505, "JavaScript": 104107, "SCSS": 82336, "Shell": 6774, "Makefile": 6254, "Dockerfile": 3835}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9414285?v=4", "stargazers": 11221, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
