This can lead to a privilege escalation scenario where an administrator can manage billing, effectively bypassing the intended role-based access control. Only users with the 'owner' role should be allowed to invite members with billing permissions. This flaw allows admins to circumvent those restrictions, gaining unauthorized access and control over billing information, posing a risk to the organizationâ€™s financial resources."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:16.107", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["lunary-ai"], "productName": ["lunary-ai/lunary"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/8ba1b8ba2c2c30b1cec30eb5777c1fda670cbbfc"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "evaluation", "hacktoberfest", "langchain", "llm", "logs", "monitoring", "observability", "openai", "prompts", "self-hosted", "testing"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1295928, "Python": 113312, "CSS": 8883, "JavaScript": 3378, "Shell": 522}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133512303?v=4", "stargazers": 1256, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
