Improper escaping of event titles could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) within the 'email preview' UI when a site has CSP disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, so the vast majority of sites are unaffected. This problem is resolved in the latest version of the discourse-calendar plugin.
