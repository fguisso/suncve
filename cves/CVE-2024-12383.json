This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'bmw_display_pv_set_page' function and insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'product_points' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."], "published": "2025-01-07T06:15:15.790", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["letscms"], "productName": ["Binary MLM Woocommerce"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
