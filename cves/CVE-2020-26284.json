Hugo depends on Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. In Hugo before version 0.79.1, if a malicious file with the same name (`exe` or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the time of running `hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one. Windows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo sites are affected. Users should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1. Other than avoiding untrusted Hugo sites, there is no workaround."], "published": "2020-12-21T23:15:12.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gohugoio"], "productName": ["hugo"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/security/advisories/GHSA-8j34-9876-pvfq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog-engine", "cms", "content-management-system", "documentation-tool", "go", "hugo", "static-site-generator"], "langs": {"Go": 5240186, "JavaScript": 159153, "HTML": 58377, "Dockerfile": 3275, "Shell": 1887, "CSS": 284}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29385237?v=4", "stargazers": 79281, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
