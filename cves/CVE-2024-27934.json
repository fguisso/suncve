Starting in version 1.36.2 and prior to version 1.40.3, use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, resulting in arbitrary code execution. Use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions. This bug is known to be exploitable for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations. Version 1.40.3 fixes this issue."], "published": "2024-03-21T02:52:22.427", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["denoland"], "productName": ["deno"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["deno", "javascript", "rust", "typescript"], "langs": {"Rust": 8071329, "JavaScript": 4952677, "TypeScript": 3550593, "CSS": 5811, "C": 4608, "C++": 1416, "HTML": 427, "WebAssembly": 304, "Dockerfile": 273, "Python": 214, "Svelte": 133, "Astro": 97, "Nunjucks": 45}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42048915?v=4", "stargazers": 102488, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
