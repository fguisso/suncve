The security check for these redirects (namely ``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()``) considered some numeric URLs \"safe\" when they shouldn't be, aka an open redirect vulnerability. Also, if a developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack."], "published": "2017-04-04T17:59:00.273", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
