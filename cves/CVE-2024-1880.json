The vulnerability arises from the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the `_speech` method of the MacOSTTS class. Specifically, the use of `os.system` to execute the `say` command with user-supplied text allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can inject shell commands. This issue is triggered when the AutoGPT instance is run with the `--speak` option enabled and configured with `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PROVIDER=macos`, reflecting back a shell injection snippet. The impact of this vulnerability is the potential execution of arbitrary code on the instance running AutoGPT. The issue was addressed in version 5.1.0."], "published": "2024-06-06T19:15:51.703", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["significant-gravitas"], "productName": ["significant-gravitas/autogpt"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/26324f29849967fa72c207da929af612f1740669"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "artificial-intelligence", "autonomous-agents", "gpt-4", "openai", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 2878491, "TypeScript": 1258928, "Dart": 203562, "PLpgSQL": 44427, "Jinja": 31626, "C++": 23419, "CMake": 18862, "JavaScript": 14039, "MDX": 12901, "CSS": 10735, "Shell": 5870, "Dockerfile": 4777, "HTML": 3023, "Ruby": 2803, "Swift": 2384, "C": 1425, "Elixir": 1068, "Batchfile": 478, "Kotlin": 140, "Objective-C": 38}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130738209?v=4", "stargazers": 174211, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
