NOTE: It has been asserted that this is not a valid vulnerability in the context of the Wordfence WordPress plugin as the firewall rules are not maintained as part of the Wordfence software but rather it is a set of rules hosted on vendor servers and pushed to the plugin with no versioning associated. Bypassing a WAF rule doesn't make a WordPress site vulnerable (speaking in terms of software vulnerabilities)."], "published": "2019-04-25T19:29:01.377", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
