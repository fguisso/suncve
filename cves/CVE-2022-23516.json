Loofah >= 2.2.0, < 2.19.1 uses recursion for sanitizing CDATA sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a SystemStackError exception.  This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue is patched in version 2.19.1. Users who are unable to upgrade may be able to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length of the strings that are sanitized."], "published": "2022-12-14T14:15:10.627", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flavorjones"], "productName": ["loofah"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/security/advisories/GHSA-3x8r-x6xp-q4vm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 181472, "HTML": 103458, "JavaScript": 288}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8207?v=4", "stargazers": 945, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
