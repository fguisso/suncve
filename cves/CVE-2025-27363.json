The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild."], "published": "2025-03-11T14:15:25.427", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FreeType"], "productName": ["FreeType"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/zhuowei/CVE-2025-27363-proof-of-concept", "https://github.com/zhuowei/CVE-2025-27363-proof-of-concept"]}
