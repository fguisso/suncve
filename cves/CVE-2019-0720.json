To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could run a specially crafted application on a guest operating system that could cause the Hyper-V host operating system to execute arbitrary code.\nAn attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Hyper-V Network Switch validates guest operating system network traffic.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:12.953", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1703", "Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows Server, version 1803  (Server Core Installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1507", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 7 Service Pack 1", "Windows 8.1", "Windows Server 2008  Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012", "Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012 R2", "Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
