Example of different renders: image, audio, video, etc. As an example of type 1 attack, an unauthorized user who only can send a large amount of data in a field of a document may use a payload with embedded javascript. This could send an export of a collection to the attacker without even an admin knowing. Other types of attacks such as dropping a database\\collection are possible."], "published": "2021-06-21T19:15:07.947", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mongo-express"], "productName": ["mongo-express"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8h-86p5-wv3p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/commit/f5e0d4931f856f032f22664b5e5901d5950cfd4b"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8h-86p5-wv3p", "kw": ["payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["express-middleware", "gui", "hacktoberfest", "hacktoberfest2020", "javascript", "mongodb", "standalone"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 129616, "HTML": 48359, "CSS": 1790, "Dockerfile": 1362}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17328297?v=4", "stargazers": 5718, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
