In `@backstage/techdocs-common` versions prior to 0.6.3, a malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs backend API. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need access to the TechDocs backend API. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`."], "published": "2021-06-03T22:15:07.873", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["backstage"], "productName": ["backstage"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-pgf8-28gg-vpr6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/8cefadca04cbf01d0394b0cb1983247e5f1d6208"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["backstage", "cncf", "developer-experience", "developer-portal", "dx", "infrastructure", "microservices", "self-service-portal"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 20410778, "CSS": 588679, "MDX": 447017, "JavaScript": 390863, "Handlebars": 43025, "Mustache": 22733, "SCSS": 11084, "Dockerfile": 11011, "HTML": 10780, "Shell": 5657, "Makefile": 5185, "HCL": 1581, "PowerShell": 698}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72526453?v=4", "stargazers": 29981, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
