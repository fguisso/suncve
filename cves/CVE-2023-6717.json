This issue may allow a malicious admin in one realm or a client with registration access to target users in different realms or applications, executing arbitrary JavaScript in their contexts upon form submission. This can enable unauthorized access and harmful actions, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the complete KC instance."], "published": "2024-04-25T16:15:10.653", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat AMQ Broker 7", "Red Hat build of Keycloak 22", "Red Hat build of Keycloak 22.0.10", "RHOSS-1.33-RHEL-8", "RHPAM 7.13.5 async", "Migration Toolkit for Applications 6", "Migration Toolkit for Applications 7", "Red Hat build of Apicurio Registry", "Red Hat build of Quarkus", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Decision Manager 7", "Red Hat Developer Hub", "Red Hat Fuse 7", "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack", "Red Hat OpenShift GitOps", "Red Hat Process Automation 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
