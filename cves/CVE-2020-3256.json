To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative privileges on the Cisco HCM-F Software. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests that contain references in XML entities to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information."], "published": "2020-05-06T17:15:12.713", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
