An issue in versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems when using Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_ API with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells, Dash and Zsh, are not affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_ is used, directory traversal may be possible in the application using _shescape_. The issue was patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g, \"\\\\~\")`."], "published": "2022-03-03T22:15:08.950", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ericcornelissen"], "productName": ["shescape"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-446w-rrm4-r47f"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["command-line", "escape-library", "security", "shell", "shell-injection", "shell-scripting"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 249564, "Shell": 1187}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3742559?v=4", "stargazers": 3, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
