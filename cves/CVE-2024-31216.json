The source-controller implements the source.toolkit.fluxcd.io API and is a core component of the GitOps toolkit. Prior to version 1.2.5, when source-controller was configured to use an Azure SAS token when connecting to Azure Blob Storage, the token was logged along with the Azure URL when the controller encountered a connection error. An attacker with access to the source-controller logs could use the token to gain access to the Azure Blob Storage until the token expires. This vulnerability was fixed in source-controller v1.2.5. There is no workaround for this vulnerability except for using a different auth mechanism such as Azure Workload Identity."], "published": "2024-05-15T16:15:10.097", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluxcd"], "productName": ["source-controller"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-v554-xwgw-hc3w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/commit/915d1a072a4f37dd460ba33079dc094aa6e72fa9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["gitops-toolkit"], "langs": {"Go": 1582413, "Shell": 10378, "Makefile": 7834, "Smarty": 4946, "Dockerfile": 938, "Ruby": 453}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52158677?v=4", "stargazers": 249, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
