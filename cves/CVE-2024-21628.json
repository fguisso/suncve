Prior to version 8.1.3, the isCleanHtml method is not used on this this form, which makes it possible to store a cross-site scripting payload in the database. The impact is low because the HTML is not interpreted in BO, thanks to twig's escape mechanism. In FO, the cross-site scripting attack is effective, but only impacts the customer sending it, or the customer session from which it was sent. This issue affects those who have a module fetching these messages from the DB and displaying it without escaping HTML. Version 8.1.3 contains a patch for this issue."], "published": "2024-01-02T22:15:09.687", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PrestaShop"], "productName": ["PrestaShop"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-vr7m-r9vm-m4wf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/c3d78b7e49f5fe49a9d07725c3174d005deaa597"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-framework", "ecommerce-platform", "hacktoberfest", "php", "php-framework", "prestashop"], "langs": {"PHP": 29299808, "TypeScript": 8884974, "Gherkin": 2686538, "Twig": 2497624, "HTML": 1695839, "JavaScript": 1449813, "Smarty": 993383, "SCSS": 501630, "Vue": 331001, "CSS": 163083, "Less": 19680, "Shell": 15714, "Makefile": 1814, "Dockerfile": 1141}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2815696?v=4", "stargazers": 8493, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
