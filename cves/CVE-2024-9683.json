This flaw affects the authentication mechanism, reducing the overall security of password enforcement.Â  While the risk is relatively low due to the typical length of the passwords used (73 characters), this vulnerability can still be exploited to reduce the complexity of brute-force or password-guessing attacks. The truncation of passwords weakens the overall authentication process, thereby reducing the effectiveness of password policies and potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access in the future."], "published": "2024-10-17T15:15:13.850", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Quay 3"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
