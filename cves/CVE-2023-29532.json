The update file can be replaced after the signature check, before the use, because the write-lock requested by the service does not work on a SMB server.\n\n*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 112, Firefox ESR < 102.10, and Thunderbird < 102.10.\n\n"], "published": "2023-06-19T10:15:09.430", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Mozilla"], "productName": ["Firefox", "Firefox ESR", "Thunderbird"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
