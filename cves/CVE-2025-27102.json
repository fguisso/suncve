Prior to version 3.3.0, when registering for an Agate account, arbitrary HTML code can be injected into a user's first and last name. This HTML is then rendered in the email sent to administrative users. The Agate service account sends this email and appears trustworthy, making this a significant risk for phishing attacks. Administrative users are impacted, as they can be targeted by unauthenticated users. Version 3.3.0 fixes the issue."], "published": "2025-03-17T14:15:21.867", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["obiba"], "productName": ["agate"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/obiba/agate/security/advisories/GHSA-v3wj-7vj5-xj5v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/obiba/agate/security/advisories/GHSA-v3wj-7vj5-xj5v", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/obiba/agate/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 879165, "FreeMarker": 191313, "Vue": 141546, "JavaScript": 53489, "TypeScript": 39751, "Shell": 13242, "Makefile": 4049, "SCSS": 2593, "Batchfile": 1038, "HTML": 988}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2547522?v=4", "stargazers": 4, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
