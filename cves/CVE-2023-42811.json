Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to version 0.10.3, in the AES GCM implementation of decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted ciphertext (i.e. the correct plaintext) is exposed even if tag verification fails. If a program using the `aes-gcm` crate's `decrypt_in_place*` APIs accesses the buffer after decryption failure, it will contain a decryption of an unauthenticated input. Depending on the specific nature of the program this may enable Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs) which can cause a catastrophic breakage of the cipher including full plaintext recovery. Version 0.10.3 contains a fix for this issue."], "published": "2023-09-22T16:15:10.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["RustCrypto"], "productName": ["AEADs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/security/advisories/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/security/advisories/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 723792}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22351541?v=4", "stargazers": 775, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
