This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.3.5 with a nonce check, which effectively prevented access to the affected function. However, version 1.3.6 incorporates the correct authorization check to prevent unauthorized access."], "published": "2024-10-16T08:15:07.323", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["themehunk"], "productName": ["WP Popup Builder – Popup Forms and Marketing Lead Generation"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/RandomRobbieBF/CVE-2024-9061", "https://github.com/RandomRobbieBF/CVE-2024-9061"]}
