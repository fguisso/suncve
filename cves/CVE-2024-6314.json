This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This can only be exploited if the 'gd' php extension is not loaded on the server."], "published": "2024-07-09T08:15:12.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rmac0001"], "productName": ["IQ Testimonials"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
