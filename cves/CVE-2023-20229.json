An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing a directory traversal attack on an affected host. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to use a cryptographic key to overwrite arbitrary files with SYSTEM-level privileges, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition or data loss on the affected system."], "published": "2023-08-16T22:15:12.213", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Duo Device Health Application"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
