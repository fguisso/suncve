Remote attackers are able to inject malicious script code into the firstname, lastname, or order input fields to provoke persistent execution in the customer and orders section of the backend. The execution occurs in the administrator backend listing when processing a preview of the customers (kunden) or orders (bestellungen). The injection can be performed interactively via user registration or by manipulation of the order information inputs. The issue can be exploited by low privileged user accounts against higher privileged (admin or moderator) accounts."], "published": "2017-10-16T04:29:00.360", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
