Grav is subject to a server side template injection (SSTI) vulnerability. The fix for another SSTI vulnerability using `|map`, `|filter` and `|reduce` twigs implemented in the commit `71bbed1` introduces bypass of the denylist due to incorrect return value from `isDangerousFunction()`, which allows to execute the payload prepending double backslash (`\\\\`). The `isDangerousFunction()` check in version 1.7.42 and onwards retuns `false` value instead of `true` when the `\\` symbol is found in the `$name`. This vulnerability can be exploited if the attacker has access to: 1. an Administrator account, or 2. a non-administrator, user account that has Admin panel access and Create/Update page permissions. A fix for this vulnerability has been introduced in commit `b4c6210` and is included in release version `1.7.42.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n"], "published": "2023-07-18T21:15:15.663", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["getgrav"], "productName": ["grav"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-9436-3gmp-4f53"], "commits": ["https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/71bbed12f950de8335006d7f91112263d8504f1b", "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/b4c62101a43051fc7f5349c7d0a5b6085375c1d7"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-9436-3gmp-4f53", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "content", "content-management", "doctrine", "flat-file", "grav", "markdown", "php", "php7", "symfony", "twig", "website", "website-builder", "website-generation", "yaml"], "langs": {"PHP": 2927078, "CSS": 8627, "Twig": 1772, "JavaScript": 1393, "Logos": 908}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8237355?v=4", "stargazers": 14863, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
