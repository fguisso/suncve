Further information on this can be found on the website of the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP). An attacker could theoretically leverage this by delivering a manipulated PDF file to the target, and depending on the environment, various actions can be executed. These actions include:\n\n  *  Reading files from the operating system\n  *  Crashing the thread handling the parsing or causing it to enter an infinite loop\n  *  Executing HTTP requests\n  *  Loading additional DTDs or XML files\n  *  Under certain conditions, executing OS commands"], "published": "2024-10-14T14:15:12.400", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Schweizerische Steuerkonferenz"], "productName": ["Library taxstatement.jar"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
