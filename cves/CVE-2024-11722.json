This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This requires an unauthenticated user to have been given permission to view form submissions, and the form submission shortcode be added to a page."], "published": "2024-12-21T10:15:07.367", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["shabti"], "productName": ["Frontend Admin by DynamiApps"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
