Prior to version 5.46.1, due to a lack of validation when filtering on the public API endpoints, it is possible to reveal private fields via a brute force attack.\n\nGhost(Pro) has already been patched. Maintainers can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version below v5.46.1. v5.46.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, add a block for requests to `/ghost/api/content/*` where the `filter` query parameter contains `password` or `email`."], "published": "2023-05-08T21:15:11.600", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["TryGhost"], "productName": ["Ghost"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/security/advisories/GHSA-r97q-ghch-82j9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/commit/b3caf16005289cc9909488391b4a26f3f4a66a90"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blogging", "cms", "creator-economy", "ghost", "hacktoberfest", "headless-cms", "jamstack", "javascript", "journalism", "nodejs", "publishing", "web-application"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 12907345, "TypeScript": 3075244, "CSS": 1160291, "Handlebars": 957600, "HTML": 300349, "Shell": 25720, "MDX": 24672, "XSLT": 6522, "Dockerfile": 5648}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2178663?v=4", "stargazers": 48904, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
