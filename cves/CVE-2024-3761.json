This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service."], "published": "2024-05-20T09:15:09.497", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["lunary-ai"], "productName": ["lunary-ai/lunary"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/14078c1d2b8766075bf655f187ece24c7a787776"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "evaluation", "hacktoberfest", "langchain", "llm", "logs", "monitoring", "observability", "openai", "prompts", "self-hosted", "testing"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1295928, "Python": 113312, "CSS": 8883, "JavaScript": 3378, "Shell": 522}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133512303?v=4", "stargazers": 1256, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
