Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report."], "published": "2022-04-13T21:15:07.820", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["composer"], "productName": ["composer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-x7cr-6qr6-2hh6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/2c40c53637c5c7e43fff7c09d3d324d632734709"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/composer/composer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["composer", "dependency-manager", "package-manager", "packages", "php"], "langs": {"PHP": 4048248}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837015?v=4", "stargazers": 28917, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
