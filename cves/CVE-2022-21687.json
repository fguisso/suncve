Versions prior to 1.1.3 are subject to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. The attacker must have access to the target host or trick an administrator into executing a malicious gh-ost command on a host running gh-ost, plus network access from host running gh-ost to the attack's malicious MySQL server. The `-database` parameter does not properly sanitize user input which can lead to arbitrary file reads."], "published": "2022-02-01T12:15:08.200", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/github/gh-ost/security/advisories/GHSA-rrp4-2xx3-mv29"], "commits": ["https://github.com/github/gh-ost/commit/a91ab042de013cfd8fbb633763438932d9080d8f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/github/gh-ost/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["mysql", "schema-migrations"], "langs": {"Go": 432462, "Shell": 30832}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4", "stargazers": 12645, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
