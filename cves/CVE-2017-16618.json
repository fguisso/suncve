A \"Load YAML\" string or file (aka load_yaml or load_yamlf) can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability."], "published": "2017-11-08T03:29:00.277", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/owlmixin/commit/5d0575303f6df869a515ced4285f24ba721e0d4e"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/owlmixin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 190456, "Makefile": 10339, "Batchfile": 7758}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9500018?v=4", "stargazers": 4, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
