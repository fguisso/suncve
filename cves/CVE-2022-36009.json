Dendrite is a Matrix homeserver written in Go, an alternative to Synapse. The power level parsing within gomatrixserverlib was failing to parse the `\"events_default\"` key of the `m.room.power_levels` event, defaulting the event default power level to zero in all cases. Power levels are the matrix terminology for user access level. In rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level had been changed, this could result in events either being incorrectly authorised or rejected by Dendrite servers. gomatrixserverlib contains a fix as of commit `723fd49` and Dendrite 0.9.3 has been updated accordingly. Matrix rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level has not been changed from the default of zero are not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-08-19T21:15:08.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["gomatrixserverlib"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/security/advisories/GHSA-grvv-h2f9-7v9c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/commit/723fd495dde835d078b9f2074b6b62c06dea4575"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 913487, "Shell": 441}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 63, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
