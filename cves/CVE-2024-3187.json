These are caused by JST values not being nulled when freed during parsing of JST templates. If the ME_GOAHEAD_JAVASCRIPT flag is enabled, a remote attacker with the privileges to modify JavaScript template (JST) files could exploit this by providing malicious templates. This may lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) or, in rare cases, code execution, though the latter is highly context-dependent."], "published": "2024-10-17T08:15:02.760", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["EmbedThis"], "productName": ["GoAhead"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
