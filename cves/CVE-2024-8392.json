This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. This can also be exploited via CSRF techniques."], "published": "2024-10-26T09:15:04.383", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["delabon"], "productName": ["WordPress Post Grid Layouts with Pagination – Sogrid"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
