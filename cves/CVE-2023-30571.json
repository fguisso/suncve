The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those directories."], "published": "2023-05-29T20:15:09.513", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
