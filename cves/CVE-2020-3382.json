The vulnerability exists because different installations share a static encryption key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the static key to craft a valid session token. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges."], "published": "2020-07-31T00:15:13.147", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Data Center Network Manager "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
