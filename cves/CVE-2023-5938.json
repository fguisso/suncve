Leveraging this issue, an attacker may be able to overwrite arbitrary files on the target filesystem and cause critical impacts on the system (e.g., arbitrary command execution on the victimâ€™s machine)."], "published": "2024-05-15T17:15:09.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Nozomi Networks"], "productName": ["Arc"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
