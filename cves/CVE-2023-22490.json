Using a specially-crafted repository, Git prior to versions 2.39.2, 2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and 2.30.8 can be tricked into using its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport. Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.\n\nA fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is impractical, two short-term workarounds are available. Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`. Instead, consider cloning repositories without recursively cloning their submodules, and instead run `git submodule update` at each layer. Before doing so, inspect each new `.gitmodules` file to ensure that it does not contain suspicious module URLs."], "published": "2023-02-14T20:15:16.683", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["git"], "productName": ["git"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gw92-x3fm-3g3q", "https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85"], "commits": ["https://github.com/git/git/commit/c867e4fa180bec4750e9b54eb10f459030dbebfd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/git/git/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "hacktoberfest", "shell"], "langs": {"C": 11479939, "Shell": 8677416, "Perl": 1166721, "Tcl": 855687, "Python": 183463, "Makefile": 172007, "Meson": 120576, "JavaScript": 49713, "CMake": 46812, "M4": 38265, "Roff": 26859, "C++": 26403, "SmPL": 15676, "Go": 15064, "CSS": 10664, "Batchfile": 9822, "Rust": 6798, "Emacs Lisp": 660, "PowerShell": 478, "ReScript": 92}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18133?v=4", "stargazers": 54138, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/smash8tap/CVE-2023-22490_PoC", "https://github.com/smash8tap/CVE-2023-22490_PoC"]}
