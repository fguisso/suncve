A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0."], "published": "2024-07-08T17:15:11.980", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["directus"], "productName": ["directus"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-7hmh-pfrp-vcx4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/543b345695071c1de61a35004bd063fe59dba0c8"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-7hmh-pfrp-vcx4", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/directus/directus/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "app", "cms", "composable", "data-visualization", "database", "directus", "graphql", "headless-cms", "javascript", "mariadb", "mssql", "mysql", "no-code", "node", "postgresql", "sql", "sqlite", "typescript", "vue"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5215942, "Vue": 1905810, "SCSS": 58308, "Liquid": 28677, "CSS": 27226, "JavaScript": 26886, "Dockerfile": 2044, "HTML": 1189}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15967950?v=4", "stargazers": 29818, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
