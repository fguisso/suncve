Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to block another user's login attempt by registering someone else'e email address as a username. A Grafana user’s username and email address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user. A user can have an email address as a username. However, the login system allows users to log in with either username or email address. Since Grafana allows a user to log in with either their username or email address, this creates an usual behavior where `user_1` can register with one email address and `user_2` can register their username as `user_1`’s email address. This prevents `user_1` logging into the application since `user_1`'s password won’t match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch. There are no workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-10-13T23:15:10.937", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["grafana"], "productName": ["grafana"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-gj7m-853r-289r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/5644758f0c5ae9955a4e5480d71f9bef57fdce35"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["alerting", "analytics", "business-intelligence", "dashboard", "data-visualization", "elasticsearch", "go", "grafana", "hacktoberfest", "influxdb", "metrics", "monitoring", "mysql", "postgres", "prometheus"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 31634526, "Go": 22690679, "HTML": 293989, "CUE": 231201, "JavaScript": 203431, "MDX": 151403, "Shell": 150950, "Starlark": 131618, "SCSS": 112108, "Jsonnet": 39410, "Makefile": 28101, "Dockerfile": 17132, "Jinja": 5716, "Python": 4687, "HCL": 4097, "CSS": 3116, "Mustache": 2716, "Smarty": 2116, "PowerShell": 367, "Assembly": 168}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195757?v=4", "stargazers": 67378, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
