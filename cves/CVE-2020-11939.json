Due to the granular nature of the overflow primitive and the ability to control both the contents and layout of the nDPI library's heap memory through remote input, this vulnerability may be abused to achieve full Remote Code Execution against any network inspection stack that is linked against nDPI and uses it to perform network traffic analysis."], "published": "2020-04-23T15:15:14.093", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/commit/7ce478a58b4dd29a8d1e6f4e9df2f778613d9202"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cybersecurity", "deep-packet-inspection", "dpi", "ndpi", "network", "traffic-analysis"], "langs": {"C": 6275252, "Lua": 163516, "C++": 129502, "Makefile": 73690, "Shell": 64354, "M4": 44136, "Python": 43017, "Ruby": 1119}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12014789?v=4", "stargazers": 3985, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
