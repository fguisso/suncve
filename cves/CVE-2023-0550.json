This is due to the fact that during menu item deletion/modification, the plugin does not verify that the post ID provided to the AJAX action is indeed a menu item. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or higher, to modify or delete arbitrary posts."], "published": "2023-01-27T21:15:11.123", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["alejandropascual"], "productName": ["Quick Restaurant Menu"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
