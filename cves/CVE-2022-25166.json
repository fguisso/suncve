It is possible to include a UNC path in the OpenVPN configuration file when referencing file paths for parameters (such as auth-user-pass). When this file is imported and the client attempts to validate the file path, it performs an open operation on the path and leaks the user's Net-NTLMv2 hash to an external server. This could be exploited by having a user open a crafted malicious ovpn configuration file."], "published": "2022-04-14T16:15:08.763", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
