When the response is sent chunked in wget before 1.19.2, the chunk parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that the chunk length is a non-negative number. The code then tries to skip the chunk in pieces of 512 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing the negative chunk length to connect.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high 32 bits of the chunk length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completely attacker controlled length argument."], "published": "2017-10-27T19:29:00.330", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["GNU Project"], "productName": ["Wget"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/r1b/CVE-2017-13089", "https://github.com/mzeyong/CVE-2017-13089", "https://github.com/r1b/CVE-2017-13089", "https://github.com/mzeyong/CVE-2017-13089"]}
