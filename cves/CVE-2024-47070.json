A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue."], "published": "2024-09-27T16:15:05.413", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["goauthentik"], "productName": ["authentik"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-7jxf-mmg9-9hg7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29", "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["authentication", "authentik", "authorization", "kubernetes", "oauth2", "oauth2-client", "oauth2-server", "oidc", "oidc-client", "oidc-provider", "proxy", "reverse-proxy", "saml", "saml-idp", "saml-sp", "security", "sso"], "langs": {"Python": 4179784, "TypeScript": 3025249, "Go": 311322, "MDX": 305954, "JavaScript": 81634, "CSS": 30409, "HTML": 28323, "Rust": 22752, "Dockerfile": 15905, "Makefile": 8860, "Shell": 8131, "PHP": 1149}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82976448?v=4", "stargazers": 15537, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
