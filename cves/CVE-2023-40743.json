When passing untrusted input to this API method, this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to RCE.\n\nAs Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code to verify no untrusted or unsanitized input is passed to \"ServiceFactory.getService\", or by applying the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210 . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome.\n\n"], "published": "2023-09-05T15:15:42.687", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Axis"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 7870594, "HTML": 160595, "XSLT": 49718, "Shell": 4402, "C#": 2362, "Batchfile": 2071}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4", "stargazers": 13, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
