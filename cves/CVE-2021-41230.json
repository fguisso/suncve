In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated."], "published": "2021-11-05T23:15:08.727", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pomerium"], "productName": ["pomerium"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/security/advisories/GHSA-j6wp-3859-vxfg"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["beyondcorp", "gateway", "go", "iam", "identity", "identity-aware-proxy", "pomerium", "reverse-proxy", "vpn", "zero-trust"], "langs": {"Go": 2996312, "TypeScript": 68508, "Jsonnet": 32800, "Shell": 9637, "Lua": 7032, "Makefile": 4018, "Python": 3228, "Dockerfile": 1093}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46059110?v=4", "stargazers": 4201, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
