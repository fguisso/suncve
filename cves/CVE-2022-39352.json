Versions prior to 0.2.5 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5. This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation."], "published": "2022-11-08T08:15:09.790", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["openfga"], "productName": ["openfga"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-3gfj-fxx4-f22w"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["abac", "authorization", "entitlements", "fga", "fine-grained-access-control", "fine-grained-authorization", "go", "golang", "hacktoberfest", "openfga", "pbac", "permissions", "rbac", "rebac", "security", "zanzibar"], "langs": {"Go": 3178271, "Makefile": 7519, "Dockerfile": 1277, "HTML": 379}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103602580?v=4", "stargazers": 3434, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
