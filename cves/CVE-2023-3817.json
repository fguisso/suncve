Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing\nCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\nan overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the \"-check\" option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue."], "published": "2023-07-31T16:15:10.497", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenSSL"], "productName": ["OpenSSL"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
