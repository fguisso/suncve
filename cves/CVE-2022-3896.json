This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is unlikely to work in modern browsers."], "published": "2022-11-29T21:15:11.293", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tipsandtrickshq"], "productName": ["WP Affiliate Platform"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
