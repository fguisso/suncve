An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a machine-in-the-middle attack on SSH connections, which could allow the attacker to intercept traffic between SSH clients and a Cisco Catalyst Center appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate the affected appliance, inject commands into the terminal session, and steal valid user credentials."], "published": "2024-09-25T17:15:15.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
