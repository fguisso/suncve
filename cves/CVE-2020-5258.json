Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. This has been patched in versions 1.12.8, 1.13.7, 1.14.6, 1.15.3 and 1.16.2"], "published": "2020-03-10T18:15:12.123", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dojo"], "productName": ["dojo"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dojo/dojo/security/advisories/GHSA-jxfh-8wgv-vfr2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dojo/dojo/commit/20a00afb68f5587946dc76fbeaa68c39bda2171d"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/dojo/dojo/security/advisories/GHSA-jxfh-8wgv-vfr2", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/dojo/dojo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dojo-toolkit", "javascript"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 6674209, "HTML": 356310, "PHP": 34498, "CSS": 6999, "Shell": 703, "Batchfile": 573, "Roff": 228}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86896?v=4", "stargazers": 1565, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
