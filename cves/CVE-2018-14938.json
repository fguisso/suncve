There is an integer overflow in the function handle_prism during caplen processing. If the caplen is less than 144, one can cause an integer overflow in the function handle_80211, which will result in an out-of-bounds read and may allow access to sensitive memory (or a denial of service)."], "published": "2018-08-05T03:29:00.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow/commit/a4e1cd14eb5ccc51ed271b65b3420f7d692c40eb"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["digital-forensics", "forensics", "tcp-protocol", "tcpip"], "langs": {"C++": 810414, "C": 89163, "M4": 85919, "Shell": 29820, "CMake": 26256, "Makefile": 6159, "Python": 2792, "HTML": 139}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1594284?v=4", "stargazers": 1727, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
