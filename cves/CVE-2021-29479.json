In versions prior to 1.9.0, a user supplied `X-Forwarded-Host` header can be used to perform cache poisoning of a cache fronting a Ratpack server if the cache key does not include the `X-Forwarded-Host` header as a cache key. Users are only vulnerable if they do not configure a custom `PublicAddress` instance. For versions prior to 1.9.0, by default, Ratpack utilizes an inferring version of `PublicAddress` which is vulnerable. This can be used to perform redirect cache poisoning where an attacker can force a cached redirect to redirect to their site instead of the intended redirect location. The vulnerability was patched in Ratpack 1.9.0. As a workaround, ensure that `ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress` correctly configures the server in production."], "published": "2021-06-29T15:15:18.870", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ratpack"], "productName": ["ratpack"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/security/advisories/GHSA-w6rq-6h34-vh7q"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 2969329, "Groovy": 1285906, "SCSS": 233385, "JavaScript": 29748, "HTML": 3968, "Shell": 1308, "CSS": 72, "Procfile": 22, "Handlebars": 20}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3344496?v=4", "stargazers": 1942, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
