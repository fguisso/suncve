The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target userâ€™s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux.
