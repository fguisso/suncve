In 0.23.1 and earlier, Sunshine's pairing protocol implementation does not validate request order and is thereby vulnerable to a MITM attack, potentially allowing an unauthenticated attacker to pair a client by hijacking a legitimate pairing attempt. This bug may also be used by a remote attacker to crash Sunshine. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.118.151840."], "published": "2025-01-20T16:15:27.667", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["LizardByte"], "productName": ["Sunshine"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-3hrw-xv8h-9499"], "commits": ["https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/commit/89f097ae65277d42b5d40163d09d92e412e6d7dd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cpp", "docker", "flathub-pkg", "game-stream", "game-streaming", "game-streaming-server", "geforce-experience", "homebrew-pkg", "maintainer-wanted", "moonlight", "pacman-pkg", "python", "remote-desktop", "replicator-custom-issues", "replicator-release-notifications", "rtd", "winget-pkg"], "langs": {"C++": 1620851, "HTML": 91098, "CMake": 82508, "Vue": 70941, "Shell": 32321, "Objective-C++": 29713, "HLSL": 12658, "Dockerfile": 12604, "Objective-C": 12591, "Cuda": 10984, "JavaScript": 10542, "Batchfile": 9595, "C": 7219, "Python": 5943, "Ruby": 4639, "GLSL": 2375, "Rust": 1770, "CSS": 375}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84790584?v=4", "stargazers": 24150, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
