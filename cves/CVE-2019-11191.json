NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that this is a vulnerability because ASLR for a.out format executables has never been supported."], "published": "2019-04-12T00:29:00.310", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
