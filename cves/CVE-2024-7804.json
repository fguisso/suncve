The vulnerability arises from the lack of security verification during the deserialization process of PythonUDF objects in pytorch/torch/distributed/rpc/internal.py. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely by sending a malicious serialized PythonUDF object, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the master node."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:37.767", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pytorch"], "productName": ["pytorch/pytorch"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
