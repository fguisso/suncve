Prior to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in `ion-java` for applications that use `ion-java` to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize Ion text or binary encoded data into the `IonValue` model and then invoke certain `IonValue` methods on that in-memory representation. An actor could craft Ion data that, when loaded by the affected application and/or processed using the `IonValue` model, results in a `StackOverflowError` originating from the `ion-java` library. The patch is included in `ion-java` 1.10.5. As a workaround, do not load data which originated from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with."], "published": "2024-01-03T23:15:08.943", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["amazon-ion"], "productName": ["ion-java"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-java/security/advisories/GHSA-264p-99wq-f4j6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-java/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 4598885, "HTML": 8350, "Kotlin": 4433, "XSLT": 367, "Shell": 105}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105071691?v=4", "stargazers": 868, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
