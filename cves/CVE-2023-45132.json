An issue present starting in version 1.3 and prior to version 1.6 allows someone to bypass the WAF when a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` IP matches `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` rules. This old code was arranged to allow older NGINX versions to also support `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` when multiple reverse proxies were present. The issue is patched in version 1.6. As a workaround, do not set any `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` for older versions.\n"], "published": "2023-10-11T21:15:10.207", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wargio"], "productName": ["naxsi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/security/advisories/GHSA-7qjc-q4j9-pc8x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/commit/1b712526ed3314dd6be7e8b0259eabda63c19537"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 268134, "Shell": 53095, "Batchfile": 1407}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/561184?v=4", "stargazers": 368, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
