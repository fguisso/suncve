The vulnerability is due to insufficient request header validation during the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious requests to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to use the acquired session token to gain full administrator access to the affected device."], "published": "2019-08-21T19:15:15.403", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Unified Computing System Director "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
