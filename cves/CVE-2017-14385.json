EMC Data Domain DD OS contains a memory overflow vulnerability in SMBv1 which may potentially be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker. An attacker may completely shut down both the SMB service and active directory authentication. This may also allow remote code injection and execution."], "published": "2017-12-20T23:29:00.250", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["EMC Data Domain DD OS EMC Data Domain DD OS 5.7 family, versions prior to 5.7.5.6, EMC Data Domain DD OS 6.0 family, versions prior to 6.0.2.9, EMC Data Domain DD OS 6.1 family, versions prior to 6.1.0.21, EMC Data Domain Virtual Edition 2.0 family, all versions, EMC Data Domain Virtual Edition 3.0 family, versions prior to 3.0 SP2 Update 1, EMC Data Domain Virtual Edition 3.1 family, versions prior to 3.1 Update 2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
