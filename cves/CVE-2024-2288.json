This vulnerability allows attackers to change a victim's profile picture without their consent, potentially leading to a denial of service by overloading the filesystem with files. Additionally, this flaw can be exploited to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser session. The issue is resolved in version 9.3."], "published": "2024-06-06T19:15:54.137", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms-webui"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/ed085e6effab2b1e25ba2b00366a16ff67d8551b"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "llm", "text-generation"], "langs": {"CSS": 3034388, "Vue": 1267094, "Python": 366554, "JavaScript": 194610, "Shell": 41865, "Batchfile": 30713, "Inno Setup": 27460, "HTML": 24508, "Jupyter Notebook": 3623, "Dockerfile": 1060}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827993?v=4", "stargazers": 4600, "language": "CSS"}}, "pocList": []}
