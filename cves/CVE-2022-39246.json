Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the key forwarding strategy implemented in the matrix-android-sdk2 that is too permissive. Starting with version 1.5.1, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-android-sdk2. The matrix-android-sdk2 will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages). As a workaroubnd, current users of the SDK can disable key forwarding in their forks using `CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`."], "published": "2022-09-28T20:15:14.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-android-sdk2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/security/advisories/GHSA-2pvj-p485-cp3m"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/commit/77df720a238d17308deab83ecaa37f7a4740a17e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Kotlin": 5337619, "Java": 12316, "Shell": 9955, "JavaScript": 1782}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 195, "language": "Kotlin"}}, "pocList": []}
