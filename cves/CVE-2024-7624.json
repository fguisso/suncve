This is due to the plugin not properly checking a users capabilities before allowing them to enable access to the plugin's settings through the update_user_access() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to grant themselves full access to the plugin's settings."], "published": "2024-08-15T03:15:05.070", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dylanjkotze"], "productName": ["Zephyr Project Manager"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
