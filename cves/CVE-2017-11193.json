These functions do not have any protections against CSRF. That can allow an attacker to run these commands against any IP if they can get an admin to visit their malicious CSRF page."], "published": "2017-07-12T20:29:00.190", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
