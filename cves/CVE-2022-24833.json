In PrivateBin < v1.4.0 a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found. The vulnerability is present in all versions from v0.21 of the project, which was at the time still called ZeroBin. The issue is caused by the fact that SVGs can contain JavaScript. This can allow an attacker to execute code, if the user opens a paste with a specifically crafted SVG attachment, and interacts with the preview image and the instance isn't protected by an appropriate content security policy. Users are advised to either upgrade to version 1.4.0 or to ensure the content security policy of their instance is set correctly."], "published": "2022-04-11T21:15:08.640", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PrivateBin"], "productName": ["PrivateBin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/security/advisories/GHSA-cqcc-mm6x-vmvw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/commit/2a4d572c1e9eb9b608d32b0cc0cb3b6c3b684eab"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/security/advisories/GHSA-cqcc-mm6x-vmvw", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["crypto", "cryptography", "encrypted", "hacktoberfest", "one-time", "paste", "pastebin", "php", "security", "self-destroy", "self-hosted", "self-hosting"], "langs": {"PHP": 514262, "JavaScript": 386777, "CSS": 186439, "Makefile": 2181, "Shell": 260, "Procfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20367028?v=4", "stargazers": 7045, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
