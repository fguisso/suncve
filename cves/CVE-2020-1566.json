An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application to take control of an affected system.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.\n"], "published": "2020-08-17T19:15:20.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 2004", "Windows Server version 2004", "Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1909", "Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1507", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
