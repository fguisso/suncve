Starting with version 12.0.0 and prior to version 12.0.9, vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone using i18n functionality. In order to be affected by this CVE, one must use next start or a custom server and the built-in i18n support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade."], "published": "2022-01-28T22:15:16.360", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-wr66-vrwm-5g5x"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog", "browser", "compiler", "components", "hybrid", "nextjs", "node", "react", "server-rendering", "ssg", "static", "static-site-generator", "universal", "vercel"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 29894335, "TypeScript": 12883869, "Rust": 7130536, "CSS": 477383, "MDX": 279532, "Shell": 9978, "SCSS": 8077, "Dockerfile": 4523, "HTML": 2644, "Batchfile": 579, "WebAssembly": 497, "Sass": 302, "Pug": 49}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14985020?v=4", "stargazers": 130849, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
