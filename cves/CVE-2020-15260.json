In version 2.10 and earlier, PJSIP transport can be reused if they have the same IP address + port + protocol. However, this is insufficient for secure transport since it lacks remote hostname authentication. Suppose we have created a TLS connection to `sip.foo.com`, which has an IP address `100.1.1.1`. If we want to create a TLS connection to another hostname, say `sip.bar.com`, which has the same IP address, then it will reuse that existing connection, even though `100.1.1.1` does not have certificate to authenticate as `sip.bar.com`. The vulnerability allows for an insecure interaction without user awareness. It affects users who need access to connections to different destinations that translate to the same address, and allows man-in-the-middle attack if attacker can route a connection to another destination such as in the case of DNS spoofing."], "published": "2021-03-10T23:15:12.300", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pjsip"], "productName": ["pjproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-8hcp-hm38-mfph"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/67e46c1ac45ad784db5b9080f5ed8b133c122872"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android", "android-ndk", "ios", "nat-traversal", "pjsip", "rtp", "sip", "voip"], "langs": {"C": 15490501, "C++": 1671762, "Python": 553464, "Shell": 399759, "Objective-C": 327121, "C#": 141563, "Java": 115523, "Makefile": 115518, "Mathematica": 86105, "SWIG": 43117, "Swift": 38034, "CSS": 21213, "Kotlin": 18705, "Rust": 4860, "Objective-C++": 3801, "HTML": 3320, "QMake": 3180, "Batchfile": 1805, "QML": 1121, "Pan": 288, "Prolog": 25}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6085234?v=4", "stargazers": 2263, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
