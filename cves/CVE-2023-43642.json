The SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. All versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3 are vulnerable to this issue. A fix has been introduced in commit `9f8c3cf74` which will be included in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only accept compressed data from trusted sources."], "published": "2023-09-25T20:15:11.723", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["xerial"], "productName": ["snappy-java"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-55g7-9cwv-5qfv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/9f8c3cf74223ed0a8a834134be9c917b9f10ceb5"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-55g7-9cwv-5qfv", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 319032, "C++": 227887, "Shell": 94403, "Makefile": 9706, "Scala": 6548, "C": 5658, "CSS": 1554, "CMake": 525}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57538?v=4", "stargazers": 1053, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
