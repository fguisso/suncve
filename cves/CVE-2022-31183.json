When establishing a server-mode `TLSSocket` using `fs2-io` on Node.js, the parameter `requestCert = true` is ignored, peer certificate verification is skipped, and the connection proceeds. The vulnerability is limited to: 1. `fs2-io` running on Node.js. The JVM TLS implementation is completely independent. 2. `TLSSocket`s in server-mode. Client-mode `TLSSocket`s are implemented via a different API. 3. mTLS as enabled via `requestCert = true` in `TLSParameters`. The default setting is `false` for server-mode `TLSSocket`s. It was introduced with the initial Node.js implementation of fs2-io in 3.1.0. A patch is released in v3.2.11. The requestCert = true parameter is respected and the peer certificate is verified. If verification fails, a SSLException is raised. If using an unpatched version on Node.js, do not use a server-mode TLSSocket with requestCert = true to establish a mTLS connection."], "published": "2022-08-01T20:15:08.410", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["typelevel"], "productName": ["fs2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/security/advisories/GHSA-2cpx-6pqp-wf35"], "commits": ["https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/commit/659824395826a314e0a4331535dbf1ef8bef8207"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["fp", "functional-programming", "scala", "stream", "streaming-computation"], "langs": {"Scala": 2356263, "HTML": 1650, "Nix": 814}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3731824?v=4", "stargazers": 2389, "language": "Scala"}}, "pocList": []}
