This is due to insufficient input validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to tamper with the generation of a unique ID on a form submission and replace the generated unique ID with a user-controlled one, leading to a loss of integrity in cases where the ID's uniqueness is relied upon in a security-specific context."], "published": "2024-05-02T17:15:09.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Gravity Wiz"], "productName": ["GP Unique ID"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/karlemilnikka/CVE-2024-0710", "https://github.com/karlemilnikka/CVE-2024-0710"]}
