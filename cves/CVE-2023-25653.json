Prior to version 2.2.0, when using the non-default \"fallback\" crypto back-end, ECC operations in `node-jose` can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, due to a possible infinite loop in an internal calculation. For some ECC operations, this condition is triggered randomly; for others, it can be triggered by malicious input. The issue has been patched in version 2.2.0. Since this issue is only present in the \"fallback\" crypto implementation, it can be avoided by ensuring that either WebCrypto or the Node `crypto` module is available in the JS environment where `node-jose` is being run."], "published": "2023-02-16T19:15:14.650", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["cisco"], "productName": ["node-jose"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/security/advisories/GHSA-5h4j-qrvg-9xhw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/commit/901d91508a70e3b9bdfc45688ea07bb4e1b8210d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 660107, "Shell": 2004}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1376999?v=4", "stargazers": 713, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
