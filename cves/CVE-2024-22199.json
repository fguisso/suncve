This vulnerability specifically impacts web applications that render user-supplied data through this template engine, potentially leading to the execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers when visiting affected web pages. The vulnerability has been addressed, the template engine now defaults to having autoescape set to `true`, effectively mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.\n"], "published": "2024-01-11T18:15:45.327", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gofiber"], "productName": ["template"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gofiber/template/security/advisories/GHSA-4mq2-gc4j-cmw6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gofiber/template/commit/28cff3ac4d4c117ab25b5396954676d624b6cb46"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gofiber/template/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["fiber", "middleware", "template", "template-engine"], "langs": {"Go": 122275, "HTML": 615, "Pug": 424, "Handlebars": 396, "Mustache": 259, "Slim": 200}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59947262?v=4", "stargazers": 287, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
