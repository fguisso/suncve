In affected versions FileServerService (media proxy) in github.com/misskey-dev/misskey 2024.10.1 or earlier did not detect proxy loops, which allows remote actors to execute a self-propagating reflected/amplified distributed denial-of-service via a maliciously crafted note. FileServerService.prototype.proxyHandler did not check incoming requests are not coming from another proxy server. An attacker can execute an amplified denial-of-service by sending a nested proxy request to the server and end the request with a malicious redirect back to another nested proxy request.\nLeading to unbounded recursion until the original request is timed out. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may configure the reverse proxy to block requests to the proxy with an empty User-Agent header or one containing Misskey/. An attacker can not effectively modify the User-Agent header without making another request to the server."], "published": "2024-12-18T20:15:23.073", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["misskey-dev"], "productName": ["misskey"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5q-c77c-v236"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activitypub", "federation", "fediverse", "microblog", "misskey"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5814681, "Vue": 2650866, "JavaScript": 573863, "SCSS": 25333, "Pug": 21058, "CSS": 5402, "Dockerfile": 5117, "Shell": 1794, "Smarty": 1782, "HTML": 1243, "MDX": 575, "Procfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81036415?v=4", "stargazers": 10468, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
