Flarum is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker to conduct a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack or disclose any file on the server, even with a basic user account on any Flarum forum. By uploading a file containing a URL and spoofing the MIME type, an attacker can manipulate the application to execute unintended actions. The vulnerability is due to the behavior of the `intervention/image` package, which attempts to interpret the supplied file contents as a URL, which then fetches its contents. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks, disclose local file contents, or conduct a blind oracle attack. This has been patched in Flarum version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable PHP's `allow_url_fopen` which will prevent the fetching of external files via URLs as a temporary workaround for the SSRF aspect of the vulnerability."], "published": "2023-08-16T21:15:09.987", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flarum"], "productName": ["framework"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-67c6-q4j4-hccg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/d1059c1cc79fe61f9538f3da55e8f42abbede570"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/flarum/framework/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["community", "flarum", "forum", "hacktoberfest", "javascript", "laravel", "php"], "langs": {"PHP": 2445956, "TypeScript": 1049067, "JavaScript": 318555, "Less": 177481, "Blade": 33637, "Hack": 5737, "Shell": 525}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5549034?v=4", "stargazers": 6528, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
