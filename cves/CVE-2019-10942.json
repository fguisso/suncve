The device contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition by sending large message packages repeatedly to the telnet service. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise availability of the device."], "published": "2019-08-13T19:15:15.453", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Siemens"], "productName": ["SCALANCE X-200 switch family (incl.
