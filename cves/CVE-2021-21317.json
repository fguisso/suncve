In uap-core before version 0.11.0, some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings. This is fixed in version 0.11.0. Downstream packages such as uap-python, uap-ruby etc which depend upon uap-core follow different version schemes."], "published": "2021-02-16T18:15:12.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ua-parser"], "productName": ["uap-core"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/security/advisories/GHSA-p4pj-mg4r-x6v4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/commit/dc9925d458214cfe87b93e35346980612f6ae96c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 15721, "Perl": 1372}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1764972?v=4", "stargazers": 783, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
