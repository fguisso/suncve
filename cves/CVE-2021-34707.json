This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to an API request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific API request to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the application."], "published": "2021-08-04T18:15:09.947", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
