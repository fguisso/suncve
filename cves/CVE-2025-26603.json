Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2025-02-18T19:15:29.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vim"], "productName": ["vim"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-63p5-mwg2-787v"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/c0f0e2380e5954f4a52a131bf6b8"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-63p5-mwg2-787v", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/vim/vim/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "cross-platform", "text-editor", "vim"], "langs": {"Vim Script": 19984759, "C": 14598137, "Roff": 576344, "Makefile": 500512, "C++": 247181, "NSIS": 191455, "M4": 160210, "Java": 85451, "Shell": 75449, "PostScript": 64070, "Module Management System": 56607, "Python": 51761, "XS": 51729, "Ruby": 40318, "JavaScript": 37774, "NewLisp": 37431, "Raku": 34258, "Emacs Lisp": 30304, "Perl": 29735, "SystemVerilog": 27883, "Smalltalk": 25762, "Awk": 19481, "Batchfile": 19178, "Objective-C": 13147, "DIGITAL Command Language": 10835, "HTML": 6885, "Prolog": 4336, "KRL": 4206, "MATLAB": 1970, "Thrift": 1670, "OpenEdge ABL": 1490, "sed": 826, "Tcl": 745, "Lua": 738, "TeX": 593, "BitBake": 388}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11618545?v=4", "stargazers": 37878, "language": "Vim Script"}}, "pocList": []}
