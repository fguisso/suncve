In affected versions an unsafe extraction is being performed using `tarfile.extractall()` from a remotely retrieved tarball. Which may lead to the writing of the extracted files to an unintended location. Sometimes, the vulnerability is called a TarSlip or a ZipSlip variant. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to overwrite any local file which the server process has access to. There is no risk of file exposure with this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in release `23.2.1.0 `. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-04-21T21:15:08.053", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mindsdb"], "productName": ["mindsdb"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/security/advisories/GHSA-2g5w-29q9-w6hx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/commit/4419b0f0019c000db390b54d8b9d06e1d3670039"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/security/advisories/GHSA-2g5w-29q9-w6hx", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["agi", "ai", "artificial-inteligence", "databases", "llms", "rag"], "langs": {"Python": 6418564, "Dockerfile": 5527, "HCL": 3806, "Makefile": 772, "HTML": 595, "Mako": 540, "Shell": 196}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31035808?v=4", "stargazers": 27621, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
