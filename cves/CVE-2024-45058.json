Prior to the 2.9 branch, an attacker with only minimal viewing privileges in the settings section is able to change their user type to Administrator (or another type with super-permissions) through a specifically crafted POST request to `/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, modifying the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. The vulnerability occurs in the file located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, which does not check the user's current permission level before allowing changes. Commit c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2024-08-28T21:15:07.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["portabilis"], "productName": ["i-educar"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/security/advisories/GHSA-53vj-fq8x-2mvg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/commit/c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/security/advisories/GHSA-53vj-fq8x-2mvg", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["brasil", "educacao", "laravel", "open-source", "php", "software-publico"], "langs": {"PHP": 8886384, "JavaScript": 808931, "Blade": 355187, "PLpgSQL": 107870, "CSS": 80968, "HTML": 6995, "Dockerfile": 1559}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/721282?v=4", "stargazers": 632, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/0xbhsu/CVE-2024-45058", "https://github.com/0xbhsu/CVE-2024-45058"]}
