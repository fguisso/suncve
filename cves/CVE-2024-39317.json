A bug in Wagtail's `parse_query_string` would result in it taking a long time to process suitably crafted inputs. When used to parse sufficiently long strings of characters without a space, `parse_query_string` would take an unexpectedly large amount of time to process, resulting in a denial of service. In an initial Wagtail installation, the vulnerability can be exploited by any Wagtail admin user. It cannot be exploited by end users. If your Wagtail site has a custom search implementation which uses `parse_query_string`, it may be exploitable by other users (e.g. unauthenticated users). Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 5.2.6, 6.0.6 and 6.1.3.\n"], "published": "2024-07-11T16:15:02.477", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wagtail"], "productName": ["wagtail"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-jmp3-39vp-fwg8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/31b1e8532dfb1b70d8d37d22aff9cbde9109cdf2", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/3c941136f79c48446e3858df46e5b668d7f83797", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/b783c096b6d4fd2cfc05f9137a0be288850e99a2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "django", "hacktoberfest", "python", "wagtail"], "langs": {"Python": 8433115, "JavaScript": 1154254, "TypeScript": 563445, "Jinja": 526959, "SCSS": 234086, "Shell": 6841, "CSS": 2719, "Dockerfile": 2038, "Makefile": 1389, "MDX": 271}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23708009?v=4", "stargazers": 19031, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
