In `evm` crate `< 0.31.0`, `JUMPI` opcode's condition is checked after the destination validity check. However, according to Geth and OpenEthereum, the condition check should happen before the destination validity check. This is a **high** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate for Ethereum mainnet. In this case, you should update your library dependency immediately to on or after `0.31.0`. This is a **low** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate in Frontier or in a standalone blockchain, because there's no security exploit possible with this advisory. It is **not** recommended to update to on or after `0.31.0` until all the normal chain upgrade preparations have been done. If you use Frontier or other `pallet-evm` based Substrate blockchain, please ensure to update your `spec_version` before updating this. For other blockchains, please make sure to follow a hard-fork process before you update this."], "published": "2021-10-18T21:15:08.353", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rust-blockchain"], "productName": ["evm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/security/advisories/GHSA-pvh2-pj76-4m96"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 286068, "Solidity": 556}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56204398?v=4", "stargazers": 1241, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
