This can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B. Users generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it). Here, that expectation is broken. Global state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs. Version 9.15.0 fixes the issue. As a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace."], "published": "2024-12-10T18:15:42.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pnpm"], "productName": ["pnpm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/security/advisories/GHSA-vm32-9rqf-rh3r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/commit/11afcddea48f25ed5117a87dc1780a55222b9743"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/security/advisories/GHSA-vm32-9rqf-rh3r", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dependency-manager", "install", "javascript", "modules", "node", "nodejs", "npm", "package-manager"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 4214100, "JavaScript": 23215, "Shell": 1076, "Batchfile": 689}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21320719?v=4", "stargazers": 31242, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
