The `siftool new` command and func siftool.New() produce predictable UUID identifiers due to insecure randomness in the version of the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` module used as a dependency. A patch is available in version >= v1.2.3 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. As a workaround, users passing CreateInfo struct should ensure the `ID` field is generated using a version of `github.com/satori/go.uuid` that is not vulnerable to this issue."], "published": "2021-05-07T21:15:07.377", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sylabs"], "productName": ["sif"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sylabs/sif/security/advisories/GHSA-4gh8-x3vv-phhg"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sylabs/sif/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 345910}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32401844?v=4", "stargazers": 18, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
