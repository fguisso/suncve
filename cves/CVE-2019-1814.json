The vulnerability is due to a failure to free system memory when an unexpected DHCP request is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device."], "published": "2019-05-16T00:29:00.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
