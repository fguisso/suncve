This flaw allows attackers to bypass brute force protection by exploiting the timing of login attempts. By initiating multiple login requests simultaneously, attackers can exceed the configured limits for failed attempts before the system locks them out. This timing loophole enables attackers to make more guesses at passwords than intended, potentially compromising account security on affected systems."], "published": "2024-09-03T20:15:09.003", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Build of Keycloak", "Red Hat build of Keycloak 22", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9", "RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
