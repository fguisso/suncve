This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's password reset code prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with knowledge of a user's email address, to reset the user's password and gain access to their account."], "published": "2024-11-26T11:21:58.660", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["scottopolis"], "productName": ["AppPresser – Mobile App Framework"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
