Missing authorization for a bound Parameter Context enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process Group.\n\nCreating a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did not check user authorization for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers, enabling clients to create Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized.\n\nThis vulnerability is limited in scope to authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with component-based authorization policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation, which includes authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process Group creation."], "published": "2024-12-28T17:15:07.967", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache NiFi"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/absholi7ly/CVE-2024-56512-Apache-NiFi-Exploit", "https://github.com/absholi7ly/CVE-2024-56512-Apache-NiFi-Exploit"]}
