A SQL injection vulnerability affects instantcms v2.16.2 in which an attacker with administrative privileges can cause the application to execute unauthorized SQL code. The vulnerability exists in index_chart_data action, which receives an input from user and passes it unsanitized to the core model `filterFunc` function that further embeds this data in an SQL statement. This allows attackers to inject unwanted SQL code into the statement. The `period` should be escaped before inserting it in the query. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available."], "published": "2024-04-04T23:15:16.540", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["instantsoft"], "productName": ["icms2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/instantsoft/icms2/security/advisories/GHSA-qx95-w566-73fw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/instantsoft/icms2/security/advisories/GHSA-qx95-w566-73fw", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/instantsoft/icms2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["backend", "cms", "cms-platform", "community", "content-management", "framework", "instantcms", "php", "social", "social-networking-engine"], "langs": {"PHP": 7310853, "JavaScript": 888410, "SCSS": 349558, "CSS": 327924, "HTML": 1587}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13232340?v=4", "stargazers": 304, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
