Versions prior to 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a `#call` method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value of the `#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have been released and fully mitigate both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the return value of `#call`."], "published": "2024-01-04T20:15:25.300", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ViewComponent"], "productName": ["view_component"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/0d26944a8d2730ea40e60eae23d70684483e5017", "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/c43d8bafa7117cbce479669a423ab266de150697"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 357825, "HTML": 18362, "Shell": 5210, "CSS": 998, "Dockerfile": 732, "Haml": 592, "Slim": 431, "JavaScript": 73}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93401166?v=4", "stargazers": 3387, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
