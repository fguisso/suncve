A vulnerability introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 allows for cross-site scripting. A bad actor can manipulate a link to include malicious HTML & JavaScript content. While the content is not saved to the database, the links may be sent to victims for malicious purposes. The injected JavaScript could hijack content & data stored in the browser, including the session. The URL content is read through the `Sourcebuster.js` library and then inserted without proper sanitization to the classic checkout and registration forms. Versions 8.8.5 and 8.9.3 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may disable the Order Attribution feature."], "published": "2024-06-12T15:15:52.677", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["woocommerce"], "productName": ["woocommerce"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/security/advisories/GHSA-cv23-q6gh-xfrf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/commit/0e9888305d0cb9557e58f558526ab11cb3bcc4b4", "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/commit/915e32a42762916b745a7e663c8b69a698da8b67"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["automattic", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-platform", "hacktoberfest", "php", "reactjs", "woocommerce", "wordpress"], "langs": {"PHP": 20394468, "TypeScript": 9682805, "JavaScript": 5962603, "SCSS": 1337177, "HTML": 439879, "Shell": 65856, "Mustache": 38188, "CSS": 28245, "Handlebars": 19564, "EJS": 14950, "Gherkin": 9169, "MDX": 8916, "Roff": 1061, "Dockerfile": 1004, "Batchfile": 155}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/473596?v=4", "stargazers": 9675, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
