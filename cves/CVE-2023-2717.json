This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'enable_safe_mode' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable safe mode, which disables all other plugins, via a forged request if they can successfully trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. A warning message about safe mode is displayed to the admin, which can be easily disabled."], "published": "2023-05-20T03:15:09.233", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["trainingbusinesspros"], "productName": ["WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award Winner â€” Groundhogg"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
