In Fleet before version 3.5.1, due to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP. Users that configure Fleet with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue. This issue is patched in 3.5.1. The fix was made using https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator If upgrade to 3.5.1 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet."], "published": "2020-12-17T20:15:13.760", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fleetdm"], "productName": ["fleet"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-w3wf-cfx3-6gcx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/commit/57812a532e5f749c8e18c6f6a652eca65c083607"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["device-management", "employee-experience", "endpoint-ops", "endpoint-security", "gitops", "mdm-api", "open-source", "osquery", "security-analytics", "vulnerability-management"], "langs": {"Go": 18256000, "JavaScript": 5465328, "TypeScript": 4471751, "Augeas": 703542, "SCSS": 353318, "EJS": 346613, "Shell": 205350, "HCL": 142498, "Less": 75399, "HTML": 62408, "PowerShell": 57307, "Ruby": 42872, "Makefile": 38069, "Open Policy Agent": 29875, "Perl": 24185, "Python": 20720, "Dockerfile": 9430, "Roff": 5414, "PHP": 3891, "Smarty": 3636, "CSS": 3483, "Puppet": 2310, "Jinja": 94}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70264713?v=4", "stargazers": 4446, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
