Prior to version 1.12.0, the PULL mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered member clusters. Since Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources. This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member clusters in Karmada. As a workaround, one may restrict the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources according to Karmada Component Permissions Docs."], "published": "2025-01-03T17:15:08.840", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["karmada-io"], "productName": ["karmada"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/security/advisories/GHSA-mg7w-c9x2-xh7r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/commit/2c82055c4c7f469411b1ba48c4dba4841df04831"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-computing", "cloud-native", "containers", "k8s", "kubernetes", "multi-cluster", "multicloud"], "langs": {"Go": 8285205, "Shell": 218463, "Smarty": 25274, "Mustache": 19603, "Makefile": 4956, "Dockerfile": 1629}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74165798?v=4", "stargazers": 4734, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
