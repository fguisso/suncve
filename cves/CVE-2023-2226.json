After crashing, the Velociraptor service will restart and it will still be possible to collect other artifacts.\n\n"], "published": "2023-04-21T12:15:07.590", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Rapid7"], "productName": ["Velociraptor"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
