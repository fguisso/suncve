An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PIMv2 packet to a PIM-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability can be exploited with either an IPv4 multicast or unicast packet."], "published": "2024-09-25T17:15:17.043", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XE Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
