NOTE: RadChart was discontinued in 2014 in favor of RadHtmlChart. All RadChart versions were affected. To avoid this vulnerability, you must remove RadChart's HTTP handler from a web.config (its type is Telerik.Web.UI.ChartHttpHandler)."], "published": "2019-12-13T18:15:11.403", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
