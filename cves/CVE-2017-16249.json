An attacker can continuously send this malformed request to keep the device inaccessible to legitimate traffic."], "published": "2017-11-10T02:29:18.607", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
