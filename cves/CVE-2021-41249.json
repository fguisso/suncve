All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later."], "published": "2021-11-04T20:15:08.597", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["graphql"], "productName": ["graphql-playground"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7", "https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/commit/b8a956006835992f12c46b90384a79ab82bcadad"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["graphiql", "graphql", "graphql-playground", "ide", "prisma"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 565895, "JavaScript": 63765, "HTML": 59642, "Shell": 3175, "CSS": 706}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12972006?v=4", "stargazers": 8813, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
