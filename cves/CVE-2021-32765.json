In affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements) context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible."], "published": "2021-10-04T21:15:12.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["redis"], "productName": ["hiredis"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/redis/hiredis/security/advisories/GHSA-hfm9-39pp-55p2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/redis/hiredis/commit/76a7b10005c70babee357a7d0f2becf28ec7ed1e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/redis/hiredis/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 399444, "Makefile": 13669, "CMake": 9077, "C++": 4233, "Shell": 2991}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529926?v=4", "stargazers": 6369, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
