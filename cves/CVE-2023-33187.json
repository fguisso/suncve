Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type=\"text\"` via a javascript \"Show Password\" button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=\"password\"` inputs. A customer may assume that switching to `type=\"text\"` would also not record this input; hence, they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show Password` button is used. This issue was patched in version 6.0.0.\nThis patch tracks changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a `type=\"password\"` continues to be obfuscated. \n"], "published": "2023-05-26T21:15:20.693", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["highlight"], "productName": ["highlight"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/highlight/highlight/security/advisories/GHSA-9qpj-qq2r-5mcc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/highlight/highlight/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["apm", "full-stack", "golang", "metrics", "monitoring", "observability", "open-source", "self-hosted", "session-replay", "tracing", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 11185582, "Go": 2482167, "JavaScript": 1286710, "Python": 172368, "Java": 159854, "CSS": 138317, "SCSS": 109363, "Ruby": 70076, "HTML": 55791, "C#": 34247, "Rust": 22144, "Dockerfile": 14581, "PHP": 9876, "Shell": 9402, "Elixir": 8279, "Makefile": 3864, "EJS": 3065, "ANTLR": 1812, "MDX": 1585, "Less": 1415, "Scheme": 353, "ASP.NET": 92}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75946842?v=4", "stargazers": 8116, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
