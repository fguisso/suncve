This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system."], "published": "2021-02-17T17:15:12.643", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/koztkozt/CVE-2021-1366", "https://github.com/koztkozt/CVE-2021-1366"]}
