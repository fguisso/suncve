(237d1e783f7ee261beaba7d3f6bde22da7148b0a was the tested vulnerable version.)"], "published": "2024-07-31T06:15:02.130", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/commit/916b37388d3851a8a93a8e9b4adc38873680ead7"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["brew", "homebrew", "macos", "package-manager", "ruby"], "langs": {"Ruby": 5260084, "Shell": 317328, "Roff": 127999, "HTML": 31633, "Rich Text Format": 5305, "Swift": 5146, "Dockerfile": 4125, "CMake": 840, "PostScript": 485}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1503512?v=4", "stargazers": 43141, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
