Extenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who don't override `objectContext()` are vulnerable to a hash collision attack which may result in a denial of service. Most applications do not implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library. `jawn-parser-1.3.1` fixes this issue and users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade override `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe collection."], "published": "2022-01-05T21:15:07.890", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["typelevel"], "productName": ["jawn"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/typelevel/jawn/security/advisories/GHSA-vc89-hccf-rq55"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/typelevel/jawn/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["json", "scala"], "langs": {"Scala": 196951, "Python": 3348}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3731824?v=4", "stargazers": 434, "language": "Scala"}}, "pocList": []}
