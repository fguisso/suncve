The decoding function base64_decode() uses an output buffer estimation function to compute the required buffer capacity and validate against the provided buffer size. The base64_estimate_decode_size() function calculates the expected decoded size with an arithmetic round-off error and does not take into account possible padding bytes. Due to this underestimation, it may be possible to craft base64 input that causes a buffer overflow."], "published": "2020-07-07T17:15:10.530", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
