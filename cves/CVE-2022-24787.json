In version 0.3.1 and prior, bytestrings can have dirty bytes in them, resulting in the word-for-word comparisons giving incorrect results. Even without dirty nonzero bytes, two bytestrings can compare to equal if one ends with `\"\\x00\"` because there is no comparison of the length. A patch is available and expected to be part of the 0.3.2 release. There are currently no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-04-04T18:15:07.877", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vyperlang"], "productName": ["vyper"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-7vrm-3jc8-5wwm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/2c73f8352635c0a433423a5b94740de1a118e508"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ethereum", "ethereum-dapp", "language", "python", "vyper"], "langs": {"Python": 2779484, "Makefile": 2222, "Batchfile": 1614, "Dockerfile": 1145, "Shell": 793}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57152025?v=4", "stargazers": 5011, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
