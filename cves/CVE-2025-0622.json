In some scenarios, hooks created by loaded modules are not removed when the related module is unloaded. This flaw allows an attacker to force grub2 to call the hooks once the module that registered it was unloaded, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. If correctly exploited, this vulnerability may result in arbitrary code execution, eventually allowing the attacker to bypass secure boot protections."], "published": "2025-02-18T20:15:23.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
