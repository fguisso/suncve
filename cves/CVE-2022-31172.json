Versions 4.1.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to the SignatureChecker reverting. `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` is not expected to revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-1271 as expected. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `SignatureChecker` to check the validity of a signature and handle invalid signatures in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1."], "published": "2022-07-22T04:15:14.633", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenZeppelin"], "productName": ["openzeppelin-contracts"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4g63-c64m-25w9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ethereum", "evm", "security", "smart-contracts", "solidity"], "langs": {"Solidity": 1339567, "JavaScript": 1293419, "Python": 170892, "Ruby": 95065, "Shell": 9308, "Makefile": 1714}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20820676?v=4", "stargazers": 25643, "language": "Solidity"}}, "pocList": []}
