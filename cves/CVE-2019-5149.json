However, the default configuration of this module appears to limit the number of concurrent php-cgi processes to two, which can be abused to cause a denial of service of the entire web server. This affects WAGO PFC200 Firmware version 03.00.39(12) and version 03.01.07(13), and WAGO PFC100 Firmware version 03.00.39(12) and version 03.02.02(14)."], "published": "2020-03-11T22:27:40.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Wago"], "productName": ["WAGO PFC200 Firmware", "WAGO PFC100 Firmware"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
