An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way in which the Shell infrastructure component handles objects in memory and preventing unintended elevation from lower integrity application.</p>\n"], "published": "2020-09-11T17:15:14.247", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows 10 Version 1909", "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
