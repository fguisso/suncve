Prior to version 10.0.1 of Publify, corresponding to versions prior to 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem, publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality. The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the administrator to click a malicious link. An attack could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or other encodings, as to not make it obvious to an administrator that this is a malicious link. A publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and become an administrator. Version 10.0.1 of Publify and version 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem fix the issue."], "published": "2025-03-28T15:15:44.647", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["publify"], "productName": ["publify"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/publify/publify/security/advisories/GHSA-8fm5-gg2f-f66q"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/publify/publify/security/advisories/GHSA-8fm5-gg2f-f66q", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/publify/publify/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog-engine", "hacktoberfest", "rails", "ruby"], "langs": {"Less": 189139, "Ruby": 130872, "HTML": 16246, "CSS": 1115}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6576968?v=4", "stargazers": 1839, "language": "Less"}}, "pocList": []}
