The typescript SDK has no awareness of to-be-spent transactions causing some transactions to fail or silently get pruned as they are funded with already used UTXOs. The problem occurs, because the `fund` function in `fuels-ts/packages/account/src/account.ts` gets the needed ressources statelessly with the function `getResourcesToSpend` without taking into consideration already used UTXOs. This issue will lead to unexpected SDK behaviour, such as a transaction not getting included in the `txpool` / in a block or a previous transaction silently getting removed from the `txpool` and replaced with a new one."], "published": "2024-07-30T20:15:04.930", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FuelLabs"], "productName": ["fuels-ts"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/security/advisories/GHSA-3jcg-vx7f-j6qf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/security/advisories/GHSA-3jcg-vx7f-j6qf", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["fuel", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 3016887, "Sway": 28984, "JavaScript": 22275, "CSS": 20715, "Handlebars": 8328, "Shell": 7686, "HTML": 2792, "Vue": 779}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55993183?v=4", "stargazers": 43843, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
