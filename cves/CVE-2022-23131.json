Malicious unauthenticated actor may exploit this issue to escalate privileges and gain admin access to Zabbix Frontend. To perform the attack, SAML authentication is required to be enabled and the actor has to know the username of Zabbix user (or use the guest account, which is disabled by default)."], "published": "2022-01-13T16:15:08.053", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Zabbix"], "productName": ["Frontend"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/qq1549176285/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/jweny/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/Mr-xn/cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/1mxml/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/zwjjustdoit/cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/L0ading-x/cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/random-robbie/cve-2022-23131-exp", "https://github.com/trganda/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/pykiller/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/Fa1c0n35/zabbix-cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/kh4sh3i/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/Kazaf6s/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/SCAMagic/CVE-2022-23131poc-exp-zabbix-", "https://github.com/Vulnmachines/Zabbix-CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/wr0x00/cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/Arrnitage/CVE-2022-23131_exp", "https://github.com/clearcdq/Zabbix-SAML-SSO-_CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/r10lab/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/fork-bombed/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/davidzzo23/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/dagowda/Zabbix-cve-2022-23131-SSO-bypass", "https://github.com/qq1549176285/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/jweny/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/Mr-xn/cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/1mxml/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/zwjjustdoit/cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/L0ading-x/cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/random-robbie/cve-2022-23131-exp", "https://github.com/trganda/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/pykiller/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/Fa1c0n35/zabbix-cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/kh4sh3i/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/Kazaf6s/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/SCAMagic/CVE-2022-23131poc-exp-zabbix-", "https://github.com/Vulnmachines/Zabbix-CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/wr0x00/cve-2022-23131", "https://github.com/Arrnitage/CVE-2022-23131_exp", "https://github.com/clearcdq/Zabbix-SAML-SSO-_CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/r10lab/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/fork-bombed/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/davidzzo23/CVE-2022-23131", "https://github.com/dagowda/Zabbix-cve-2022-23131-SSO-bypass"]}
