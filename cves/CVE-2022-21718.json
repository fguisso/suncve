A vulnerability in versions prior to `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` allows renderers to obtain access to a bluetooth device via the web bluetooth API if the app has not configured a custom `select-bluetooth-device` event handler. This has been patched and Electron versions `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` contain the fix. Code from the GitHub Security Advisory can be added to the app to work around the issue."], "published": "2022-03-22T17:15:07.810", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["electron"], "productName": ["electron"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-3p22-ghq8-v749"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/electron/electron/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c-plus-plus", "chrome", "css", "electron", "html", "javascript", "nodejs", "v8", "works-with-codespaces"], "langs": {"C++": 3900683, "TypeScript": 2231326, "Objective-C++": 392824, "JavaScript": 145343, "Python": 131218, "Objective-C": 41773, "HTML": 12057, "Shell": 8704, "C": 2472, "CSS": 2369}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13409222?v=4", "stargazers": 116233, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
