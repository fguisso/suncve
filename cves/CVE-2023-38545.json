Due to this bug,\nthe local variable that means \"let the host resolve the name\" could get the\nwrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,\ncopy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the\nresolved address there.\n\nThe target buffer being a heap based buffer, and the host name coming from the\nURL that curl has been told to operate with.\n"], "published": "2023-10-18T04:15:11.077", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["curl"], "productName": ["curl"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/UTsweetyfish/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/imfht/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/fatmo666/CVE-2023-38545-libcurl-SOCKS5-heap-buffer-overflow", "https://github.com/vanigori/CVE-2023-38545-sample", "https://github.com/dbrugman/CVE-2023-38545-POC", "https://github.com/bcdannyboy/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/d0rb/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/Yang-Shun-Yu/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/nphuang/NS-Project-2024-Spring", "https://github.com/UTsweetyfish/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/imfht/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/fatmo666/CVE-2023-38545-libcurl-SOCKS5-heap-buffer-overflow", "https://github.com/vanigori/CVE-2023-38545-sample", "https://github.com/dbrugman/CVE-2023-38545-POC", "https://github.com/bcdannyboy/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/d0rb/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/Yang-Shun-Yu/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/nphuang/NS-Project-2024-Spring"]}
