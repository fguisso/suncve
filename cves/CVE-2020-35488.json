This attack requires a specific configuration. Also, the name of the directory created must use a Syslog field. (For example, on Linux it is not possible to create a .. directory. On Windows, it is not possible to create a CON directory.)"], "published": "2021-01-05T15:15:13.797", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/GuillaumePetit84/CVE-2020-35488", "https://github.com/githubfoam/nxlog-ubuntu-githubactions", "https://github.com/GuillaumePetit84/CVE-2020-35488", "https://github.com/githubfoam/nxlog-ubuntu-githubactions"]}
