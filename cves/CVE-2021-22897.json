The selected cipher set was stored in a single \"static\" variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly."], "published": "2021-06-11T16:15:10.963", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["https://github.com/curl/curl"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/bbb71507b7bab52002f9b1e0880bed6a32834511"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/curl/curl/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "client", "curl", "ftp", "gopher", "hacktoberfest", "http", "https", "imaps", "ldap", "libcurl", "library", "mqtt", "pop3", "scp", "sftp", "transfer-data", "transferring-data", "user-agent", "websocket"], "langs": {"C": 7980094, "Perl": 862039, "M4": 511636, "Python": 467183, "CMake": 290967, "DIGITAL Command Language": 237294, "Shell": 139333, "Makefile": 122565, "Batchfile": 43953, "Dockerfile": 1711, "Raku": 1598, "Emacs Lisp": 1348}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16928085?v=4", "stargazers": 37377, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
