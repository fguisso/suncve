This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity through the alloggio_membership_init_rest_api_facebook_login and alloggio_membership_init_rest_api_google_login functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators, without knowing a password."], "published": "2025-03-01T08:15:34.167", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Edge-Themes"], "productName": ["Alloggio Membership"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
