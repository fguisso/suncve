This will result in file disclosure (i.e., being able to pull any file from the remote victim application). This can be used to steal and obtain sensitive config and other files. This can result in complete compromise of the application. The script parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal and both local and remote file inclusion."], "published": "2019-09-23T15:15:10.637", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/0x6b7966/CVE-2019-13063-POC", "https://github.com/0x6b7966/CVE-2019-13063-POC"]}
