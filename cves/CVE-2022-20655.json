An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting commands during the execution of this process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privilege level of ConfD, which is commonly root."], "published": "2024-11-15T16:15:20.987", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XR Software", "Cisco Virtual Topology System (VTS)", "Cisco Network Services Orchestrator", "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software", "Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN", "Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager", "Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN", "Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Router", "Cisco Ultra Gateway Platform", "Cisco Carrier Packet Transport"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
