The vulnerabilities exist because the software insufficiently validates user-supplied input on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. An attacker would need administrator privileges on the device to exploit these vulnerabilities."], "published": "2019-05-03T16:29:00.367", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software ", "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
