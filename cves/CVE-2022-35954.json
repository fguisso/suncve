The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`."], "published": "2022-08-15T11:21:39.040", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["actions"], "productName": ["toolkit"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/actions/toolkit/security/advisories/GHSA-7r3h-m5j6-3q42"], "commits": ["https://github.com/actions/toolkit/commit/4beda9cbc00ba6eefe387a937c21087ccb8ee9df"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/actions/toolkit/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 763334, "JavaScript": 5814, "PowerShell": 2276, "Shell": 478, "Batchfile": 393, "C#": 296}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44036562?v=4", "stargazers": 5232, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
