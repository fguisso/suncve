If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough. This vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2."], "published": "2019-12-05T20:15:10.093", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["puma"], "productName": ["puma"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-7xx3-m584-x994"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/puma/puma/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["multithreading", "rack", "ruby", "server"], "langs": {"Ruby": 744971, "C": 59303, "Java": 43602, "Ragel": 9223, "Shell": 9208, "PowerShell": 3326, "Dockerfile": 1455, "Lua": 127, "Batchfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1264292?v=4", "stargazers": 7745, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
