This makes it possible with attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply paths to arbitrary files on the server that will subsequently be deleted. This can be used to delete the wp-config.php file that can allow an attacker to configure the site and achieve remote code execution."], "published": "2022-11-29T21:15:11.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["simplepress"], "productName": ["Simple:Press â€“ WordPress Forum Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
