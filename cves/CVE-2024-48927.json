There is a potential risk of code execution for Backoffice users when they “preview” SVG files in full screen mode. Versions 13.5.2, 10.8,7, and 8.18.15 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, derver-side file validation is available to strip script tags from file's content during the file upload process."], "published": "2024-10-22T16:15:08.360", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["umbraco"], "productName": ["Umbraco-CMS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-5955-cwv4-h7qh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asp-net-core", "cms", "csharp", "dotnet-core", "hacktoberfest", "umbraco", "umbraco-cms"], "langs": {"C#": 19789884, "TypeScript": 11686920, "JavaScript": 103162, "HTML": 62862, "CSS": 20178, "MDX": 12163, "Dockerfile": 2714, "Shell": 1652, "TSQL": 159}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419552?v=4", "stargazers": 4807, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
