SRTP is a higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other than UDP. This vulnerabilityâ€™s impact may range from unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The patch is available as a commit in the master branch.\n"], "published": "2023-10-06T14:15:12.020", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pjsip"], "productName": ["pjproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-f76w-fh7c-pc66"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/6dc9b8c181aff39845f02b4626e0812820d4ef0d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android", "android-ndk", "ios", "nat-traversal", "pjsip", "rtp", "sip", "voip"], "langs": {"C": 15490501, "C++": 1671762, "Python": 553464, "Shell": 399759, "Objective-C": 327121, "C#": 141563, "Java": 115523, "Makefile": 115518, "Mathematica": 86105, "SWIG": 43117, "Swift": 38034, "CSS": 21213, "Kotlin": 18705, "Rust": 4860, "Objective-C++": 3801, "HTML": 3320, "QMake": 3180, "Batchfile": 1805, "QML": 1121, "Pan": 288, "Prolog": 25}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6085234?v=4", "stargazers": 2263, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
