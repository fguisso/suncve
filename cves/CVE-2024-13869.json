This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers."], "published": "2025-02-22T13:15:10.920", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wpvividplugins"], "productName": ["Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid Backup & Migration"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/d0n601/CVE-2024-13869", "https://github.com/d0n601/CVE-2024-13869"]}
