Prior to version 1.2.0, multiple out-of-bounds reads when decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of service. A 32-bit integer overflow condition can lead to incorrect checks of consistency of length of internal buffers. Although most applications will error out before accepting a singe input buffer of 4GB in length this could theoretically happen. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the application allows tokens greater than 4GB in length. This can lead to a large, up to 65KB, out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-service if it reads from unmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch for the out-of-bounds reads."], "published": "2023-02-14T18:15:13.077", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gssapi"], "productName": ["gss-ntlmssp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjx-5qf7-9mgf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/97c62c6167299028d80765080e74d91dfc99efbd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 476794, "M4": 9365, "Makefile": 6335, "Shell": 1817}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63316684?v=4", "stargazers": 31, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
