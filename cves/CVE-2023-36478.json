In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values to\nexceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295\nwill overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2023-10-10T17:15:11.737", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["eclipse"], "productName": ["jetty.project"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-wgh7-54f2-x98r"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["eclipse", "embedded", "fcgi", "http", "http-client", "http-server", "http2", "http2-push", "http3", "https", "jakartaee", "java", "jetty", "jsp", "osgi", "servlet", "ssl", "tls", "unix-socket", "websockets"], "langs": {"Java": 36213570, "JavaScript": 171477, "HTML": 143105, "AMPL": 142108, "Groovy": 48831, "Shell": 31096, "CSS": 24387, "XSLT": 2658}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143739000?v=4", "stargazers": 3908, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
