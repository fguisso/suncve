An attacker could send malicious packets to the smart phones within radio range by special wireless device, which leads stack overflow when the baseband module handles these packets. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform a denial of service attack or remote code execution in baseband module."], "published": "2017-12-22T17:29:13.063", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd."], "productName": ["Mate 10", "Mate 10 Pro", "Mate 9", "Mate 9 Pro"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
