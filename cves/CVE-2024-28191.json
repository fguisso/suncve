Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, it is possible to inject insert tags in frontend forms if the output is structured in a very specific way. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not output user data from frontend forms next to each other, always separate them by at least one character."], "published": "2024-04-09T14:15:08.710", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["contao"], "productName": ["contao"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/contao/contao/security/advisories/GHSA-747v-52c4-8vj8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/contao/contao/commit/388859dcf110ca70e0fae68a2a5579ab6a702919", "https://github.com/contao/contao/commit/474a2fc25f1d84d786aba8c6d234af99e64d016b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/contao/contao/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "contao", "monorepo", "php", "symfony"], "langs": {"PHP": 9070010, "Twig": 162859, "JavaScript": 160130, "CSS": 112526}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1206136?v=4", "stargazers": 367, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
