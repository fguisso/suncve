The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors."], "published": "2019-06-05T17:29:00.680", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Industrial Network Director "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Shadawks/Strapi-CVE-2019-1881", "https://github.com/Shadawks/Strapi-CVE-2019-1881"]}
