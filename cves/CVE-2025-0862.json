This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is limited to Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Edge, Brave)."], "published": "2025-02-11T11:15:16.043", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["supersaas"], "productName": ["SuperSaaS – online appointment scheduling"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
