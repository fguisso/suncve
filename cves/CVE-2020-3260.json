The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of client packets that are sent to an affected access point (AP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of sustained client packets to the affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected AP to crash, resulting in a DoS condition."], "published": "2020-04-15T21:15:35.997", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Aironet Access Point Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
