One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI."], "published": "2024-11-21T18:15:12.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["drakkan"], "productName": ["sftpgo"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/security/advisories/GHSA-49cc-xrjf-9qf7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/88b1850b5806eee81150873d4e565144b21021fb", "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/b524da11e9466d05fe03304713ee1c61bb276ec4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["azure-blob", "cloud-storage", "data-at-rest-encryption", "docker", "ftp", "ftp-server", "git", "go", "google-cloud-storage", "multi-factor-authentication", "portable", "prometheus", "proxy-protocol", "s3", "scp", "sftp", "sftp-server", "webdav", "webdav-server"], "langs": {"Go": 5967435, "HTML": 1002700, "Shell": 8480, "Inno Setup": 5460, "Dockerfile": 2719, "JavaScript": 2387, "PowerShell": 1982, "CSS": 202, "Makefile": 157}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/553263?v=4", "stargazers": 10205, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
