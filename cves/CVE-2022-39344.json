Prior to version 6.1.12, the USB DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function prevents buffer overflow during handling of DFU UPLOAD command when current state is `UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_IDLE`. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 6.1.12. As a workaround, add the `UPLOAD_LENGTH` check in all possible states."], "published": "2022-11-04T20:15:10.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["azure-rtos"], "productName": ["usbx"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-m9p8-xrp7-vvqp"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["eclipse-threadx", "embedded", "iot", "mcu", "microcontroller", "rtos", "usb", "usb-hid", "usb-host"], "langs": {"C": 21768724, "CMake": 124455, "Shell": 5999}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156018450?v=4", "stargazers": 180, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
