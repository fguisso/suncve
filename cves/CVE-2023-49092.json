Due to a non-constant-time implementation, information about the private key is leaked through timing information which is observable over the network. An attacker may be able to use that information to recover the key. There is currently no fix available. As a workaround, avoid using the RSA crate in settings where attackers are able to observe timing information, e.g. local use on a non-compromised computer."], "published": "2023-11-28T21:15:08.530", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["RustCrypto"], "productName": ["RSA"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/security/advisories/GHSA-c38w-74pg-36hr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 289703, "Shell": 4219, "Dockerfile": 637}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22351541?v=4", "stargazers": 589, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
