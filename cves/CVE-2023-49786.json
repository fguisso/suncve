In Asterisk prior to versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1; as well as certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6; Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. Commit d7d7764cb07c8a1872804321302ef93bf62cba05 contains a fix, which is part of versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, 21.0.1, amd 18.9-cert6."], "published": "2023-12-14T20:15:52.927", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["asterisk"], "productName": ["asterisk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-hxj9-xwr8-w8pq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/d7d7764cb07c8a1872804321302ef93bf62cba05"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asterisk", "c", "pbx", "sip", "voip"], "langs": {"C": 36729260, "Python": 359115, "Shell": 261117, "M4": 191704, "Makefile": 136302, "Perl": 111005, "Yacc": 64828, "Mustache": 26327, "Lex": 26043, "XSLT": 15366, "Vim Script": 11793, "HTML": 11310, "Roff": 10448, "JavaScript": 7906, "Tcl": 4198, "PHP": 2106, "Mako": 1730, "CSS": 1031, "Awk": 642}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2914369?v=4", "stargazers": 2482, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
