This flag allows output template expansion in its argument, so that metadata values may be used in the shell commands. The metadata fields can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended to quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell. However, the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows) does not properly escape special characters, which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec` is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special character. `\\n` will be replaced by `\\r` as no way of escaping it has been found. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using --exec, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade: 1. Avoid using any output template expansion in --exec other than {} (filepath). 2. If expansion in --exec is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain \", | or &. 3. Instead of using --exec, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.\n"], "published": "2023-09-25T19:15:09.960", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["yt-dlp"], "productName": ["yt-dlp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-42h4-v29r-42qg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/de015e930747165dbb8fcd360f8775fd973b7d6e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["python", "sponsorblock", "video-downloader", "youtube-dl", "youtube-dlc", "youtube-downloader", "yt-dlp"], "langs": {"Python": 9947243, "Makefile": 7825, "Shell": 551, "Dockerfile": 461, "Batchfile": 47}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79589310?v=4", "stargazers": 106747, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
