Parsing the numeric header fields in a SIP message (like cseq, ttl, port, etc.) all had the potential to overflow, either causing unintended values to be captured or, if the values were subsequently converted back to strings, a buffer overrun. This will lead to a potential exploit using carefully crafted invalid values."], "published": "2017-11-17T09:29:00.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
