A bypass of CVE-2020-26231 (fixed in 1.0.470/471 and 1.1.1) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-26231 & CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 472 (v1.0.472) and v1.1.2. As a workaround, apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/f63519ff1e8d375df30deba63156a2fc97aa9ee7 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.2."], "published": "2021-05-03T16:15:07.510", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["octobercms"], "productName": ["october"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-fcr8-6q7r-m4wg"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["backend", "cmf", "cms", "cms-platform", "framework", "laravel", "octobercms", "php", "platform"], "langs": {"PHP": 2058359, "HTML": 84434, "CSS": 58023, "JavaScript": 22950, "Hack": 1770}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5554805?v=4", "stargazers": 11090, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
