Starting in version 2.49.0 and prior to version 2.67.0, under certain conditions, a bug in GitHub's Artifact Attestation cli tool `gh attestation verify` causes it to return a zero exit status when no attestations are present. This behavior is incorrect: When no attestations are present, `gh attestation verify` should return a non-zero exit status code, thereby signaling verification failure. An attacker can abuse this flaw to, for example, deploy malicious artifacts in any system that uses `gh attestation verify`'s exit codes to gatekeep deployments. Users are advised to update `gh` to patched version `v2.67.0` as soon as possible."], "published": "2025-02-14T17:15:19.140", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["cli"], "productName": ["cli"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-fgw4-v983-mgp8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-fgw4-v983-mgp8", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/cli/cli/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cli", "git", "github-api-v4", "golang"], "langs": {"Go": 4827142, "Shell": 16116, "Makefile": 3402, "PowerShell": 569, "Batchfile": 26}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59704711?v=4", "stargazers": 38777, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
