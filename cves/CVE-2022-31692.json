Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true: The application expects that Spring Security applies security to forward and include dispatcher types. The application uses the AuthorizationFilter either manually or via the authorizeHttpRequests() method. The application configures the FilterChainProxy to apply to forward and/or include requests (e.g. spring.security.filter.dispatcher-types = request, error, async, forward, include). The application may forward or include the request to a higher privilege-secured endpoint.The application configures Spring Security to apply to every dispatcher type via authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)"], "published": "2022-10-31T20:15:12.783", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Spring by VMware"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/blipzip/cve-2022-31692", "https://github.com/hotblac/cve-2022-31692", "https://github.com/blipzip/cve-2022-31692", "https://github.com/hotblac/cve-2022-31692"]}
