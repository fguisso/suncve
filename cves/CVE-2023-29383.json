Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that \"cat /etc/passwd\" shows a rogue user account."], "published": "2023-04-14T22:15:07.680", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Shell": 1668502, "C": 1274708, "Python": 46991, "M4": 26013, "Makefile": 17850, "Yacc": 15625, "Perl": 3114}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4657399?v=4", "stargazers": 336, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
