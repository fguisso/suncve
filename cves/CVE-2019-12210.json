This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation."], "published": "2019-06-04T21:29:00.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f/commit/18b1914e32b74ff52000f10e97067e841e5fff62"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["fido2", "pam-module", "u2f", "yubikey"], "langs": {"C": 179045, "M4": 53214, "Shell": 12804, "CMake": 11747, "Makefile": 5710, "Python": 4974, "Dockerfile": 509, "Gnuplot": 293}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/531825?v=4", "stargazers": 571, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
