When a user uploads a file with a `.xsig` extension and directly accesses this file, the server responds with a Content-type of application/octet-stream, leading to the file being processed as an HTML file. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code, which can be used to steal user cookies, perform HTTP requests, and access content of the same origin."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:32.473", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flatpressblog"], "productName": ["flatpressblog/flatpress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/commit/3c9cc69364a45fd3f92d4bd606344b5dd1205d6a"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog", "blogging", "blogging-engine", "flatfile", "flatpress", "nosql", "php", "website"], "langs": {"PHP": 3238706, "JavaScript": 143255, "Smarty": 117845, "CSS": 97740, "Yacc": 40745, "HTML": 32535, "Shell": 964}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46045252?v=4", "stargazers": 190, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
