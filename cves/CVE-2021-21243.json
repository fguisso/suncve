In OneDev before version 4.0.3, a Kubernetes REST endpoint exposes two methods that deserialize untrusted data from the request body. These endpoints do not enforce any authentication or authorization checks. This issue may lead to pre-auth RCE. This issue was fixed in 4.0.3 by not using deserialization at KubernetesResource side."], "published": "2021-01-15T20:15:12.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["theonedev"], "productName": ["onedev"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-9mmq-fm8c-q4fv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/9637fc8fa461c5777282a0021c3deb1e7a48f137"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-9mmq-fm8c-q4fv", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ci-cd", "devops", "git", "kanban", "packages", "self-hosted"], "langs": {"Java": 11684939, "JavaScript": 733568, "HTML": 398349, "CSS": 180299, "Shell": 116784, "ANTLR": 47309, "Smarty": 17174, "Python": 5761, "Mustache": 3983, "Dockerfile": 125}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44279871?v=4", "stargazers": 13837, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
