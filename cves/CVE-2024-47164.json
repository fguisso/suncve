This vulnerability relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the `is_in_or_equal` function. This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory, can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying on Gradioâ€™s blocklist or directory access validation, particularly when handling file uploads. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually sanitize and normalize file paths in their Gradio deployment before passing them to the `is_in_or_equal` function. Ensuring that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute can help mitigate the bypass vulnerabilities caused by the improper handling of `..` sequences or malformed paths."], "published": "2024-10-10T22:15:10.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gradio-app"], "productName": ["gradio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-77xq-6g77-h274"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-analysis", "data-science", "data-visualization", "deep-learning", "deploy", "gradio", "gradio-interface", "hacktoberfest", "interface", "machine-learning", "models", "python", "python-notebook", "ui", "ui-components"], "langs": {"Python": 3243620, "Svelte": 1268769, "TypeScript": 1046794, "mdsvex": 217599, "CSS": 72732, "JavaScript": 62299, "Jupyter Notebook": 32113, "HTML": 22988, "Batchfile": 6427, "Shell": 6015, "MDX": 1670, "Dockerfile": 128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51063788?v=4", "stargazers": 37296, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
