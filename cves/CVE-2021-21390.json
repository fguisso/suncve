In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z, there is a vulnerability which enables MITM modification of request bodies that are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk. This check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the chunk + thereby without ever checking the chunk signature. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z. As a workaround one can avoid using \"aws-chunked\" encoding-based chunk signature upload requests instead use TLS. MinIO SDKs automatically disable chunked encoding signature when the server endpoint is configured with TLS."], "published": "2021-03-19T16:15:12.920", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["minio"], "productName": ["minio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-7gpj-5pgp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/e197800f9055489415b53cf137e31e194aaf7ba0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/minio/minio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["amazon-s3", "cloud", "cloudnative", "cloudstorage", "go", "k8s", "kubernetes", "multi-cloud", "multi-cloud-kubernetes", "objectstorage", "s3", "storage"], "langs": {"Go": 8721848, "Shell": 72041, "Makefile": 11677, "Mustache": 6628, "Smarty": 872, "Dockerfile": 229}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/695951?v=4", "stargazers": 51341, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
