Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, the `ValidateCore::isCleanHTML()` method of Prestashop misses hijackable events which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup `@keyframes` methods. This XSS, which hijacks HTML attributes, can be triggered without any interaction by the visitor/administrator, which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS attack. Contrary to other attacks which target HTML attributes and are triggered without user interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope. Versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9 contain a fix for this issue."], "published": "2023-04-25T19:15:11.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PrestaShop"], "productName": ["PrestaShop"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-fh7r-996q-gvcp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/46408ae4b02f3b8b1bb6e9dc63af5bcd858abd9c", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/dc682192df0e4b0d656a8e645b29ca1b9dbe3693"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-framework", "ecommerce-platform", "hacktoberfest", "php", "php-framework", "prestashop"], "langs": {"PHP": 29299808, "TypeScript": 8884974, "Gherkin": 2686538, "Twig": 2497624, "HTML": 1695839, "JavaScript": 1449813, "Smarty": 993383, "SCSS": 501630, "Vue": 331001, "CSS": 163083, "Less": 19680, "Shell": 15714, "Makefile": 1814, "Dockerfile": 1141}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2815696?v=4", "stargazers": 8493, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
