An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve the memory address of a kernel object.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles memory addresses.\n"], "published": "2020-08-17T19:15:21.240", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1909", "Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 2004", "Windows Server version 2004"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
