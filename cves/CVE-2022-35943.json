This vulnerability may allow [SameSite Attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the [CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.html) mechanism with CodeIgniter Shield. For this attack to succeed, the attacker must have direct (or indirect, e.g., XSS) control over a subdomain site (e.g., `https://a.example.com/`) of the target site (e.g., `http://example.com/`). Upgrade to **CodeIgniter v4.2.3 or later** and **Shield v1.0.0-beta.2 or later**. As a workaround: set `Config\\Security::$csrfProtection` to `'session,'`remove old session data right after login (immediately after ID and password match) and regenerate CSRF token right after login (immediately after ID and password match)"], "published": "2022-08-12T21:15:07.803", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["codeigniter4"], "productName": ["shield"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/security/advisories/GHSA-5hm8-vh6r-2cjq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["auth", "authentication", "authorization", "codeigniter4"], "langs": {"PHP": 886900, "Shell": 1111}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44521256?v=4", "stargazers": 383, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
