In affected versions missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson` allows an attacker to create fake user profiles and forged notes. The spoofed users will appear to be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist, and the forged notes will appear to be posted by a different user. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept the spoofed objects as valid, allowing an attacker to impersonate other users and instances. The attacker retains full control of the spoofed user / note and can interact like a real account. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-12-18T20:15:23.697", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["misskey-dev"], "productName": ["misskey"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-m2gq-69fp-6hv4"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activitypub", "federation", "fediverse", "microblog", "misskey"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5814681, "Vue": 2650866, "JavaScript": 573863, "SCSS": 25333, "Pug": 21058, "CSS": 5402, "Dockerfile": 5117, "Shell": 1794, "Smarty": 1782, "HTML": 1243, "MDX": 575, "Procfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81036415?v=4", "stargazers": 10468, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
