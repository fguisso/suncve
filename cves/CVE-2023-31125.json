An uncaught exception vulnerability was introduced in version 5.1.0 and included in version 4.1.0 of the `socket.io` parent package. Older versions are not impacted. A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io` package, including those who use depending packages like `socket.io`. This issue was fixed in version 6.4.2 of Engine.IO. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.\n"], "published": "2023-05-08T21:15:11.347", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["socketio"], "productName": ["engine.io"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-q9mw-68c2-j6m5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/fc480b4f305e16fe5972cf337d055e598372dc44"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "nodejs", "real-time", "websocket"], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10566080?v=4", "stargazers": 4593, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
