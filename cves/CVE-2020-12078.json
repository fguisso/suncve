There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address."], "published": "2020-04-28T14:15:14.203", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/Opmantek/open-audit/commit/6ffc7f9032c55eaa1c37cf5e070809b7211c7e9a"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/Opmantek/open-audit/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 14891895, "CSS": 724413, "VBScript": 458074, "Shell": 303801, "PowerShell": 137442, "JavaScript": 25176, "Perl": 2289, "HTML": 1340}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11534497?v=4", "stargazers": 171, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/mhaskar/CVE-2020-12078", "https://github.com/84KaliPleXon3/CVE-2020-12078", "https://github.com/mhaskar/CVE-2020-12078", "https://github.com/84KaliPleXon3/CVE-2020-12078"]}
