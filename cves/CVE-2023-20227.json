An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted L2TP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-09-27T18:15:11.370", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XE Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
