An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted script or application.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Print Spooler Component writes to the file system.\n"], "published": "2020-08-17T19:15:14.210", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 2004", "Windows Server version 2004", "Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1909", "Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1507", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 7", "Windows 7 Service Pack 1", "Windows 8.1", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2008  Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012", "Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012 R2", "Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/math1as/CVE-2020-1337-exploit", "https://github.com/VoidSec/CVE-2020-1337", "https://github.com/neofito/CVE-2020-1337", "https://github.com/sailay1996/cve-2020-1337-poc", "https://github.com/ZTK-009/cve-2020-1337-poc", "https://github.com/math1as/CVE-2020-1337-exploit", "https://github.com/VoidSec/CVE-2020-1337", "https://github.com/neofito/CVE-2020-1337", "https://github.com/sailay1996/cve-2020-1337-poc", "https://github.com/ZTK-009/cve-2020-1337-poc"]}
