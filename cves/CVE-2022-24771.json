Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-03-18T14:15:10.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["digitalbazaar"], "productName": ["forge"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765"], "commits": ["https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/3f0b49a0573ef1bb7af7f5673c0cfebf00424df1"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aes", "asn1", "certificate", "cipher", "crypto", "cryptography", "csr", "hmac", "javascript", "md5", "message-digest", "pbkdf2", "pkcs", "pkcs1", "pkcs12", "pkcs7", "sha1", "sha256", "tls", "x509"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1642997, "HTML": 73308, "ActionScript": 25864, "C": 13441, "Python": 3547, "CSS": 1244}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167436?v=4", "stargazers": 5153, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
