An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server to crash.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who already has a privileged account on a guest operating system, running as a virtual machine, could run a specially crafted application that causes a host machine to crash.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how virtual machines access the Hyper-V Network Switch.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:12.783", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
