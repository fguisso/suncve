Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the 'project_name' parameter in a GET request to download arbitrary files from the system. This issue affects the latest version of the repository. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation in the 'download_project' function, allowing attackers to traverse the directory structure and access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server."], "published": "2024-06-27T18:15:20.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stitionai"], "productName": ["stitionai/devika"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/stitionai/devika/commit/6acce21fb08c3d1123ef05df6a33912bf0ee77c2"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/stitionai/devika/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 126787, "Svelte": 48724, "Jinja": 19899, "JavaScript": 18737, "CSS": 2939, "Dockerfile": 2089, "Makefile": 798, "HTML": 504, "Shell": 119}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153954657?v=4", "stargazers": 19116, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
