This then caused a javascript error on topic pages because we were looking for an `<a>` element inside the footnote reference span and getting its ID, and because it did not exist we got a null reference error in javascript. Users are advised to update to version 0.2. As a workaround editing offending posts from the rails console or the database console for self-hosters, or disabling the plugin in the admin panel can mitigate this issue."], "published": "2021-12-14T23:15:08.020", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["discourse-footnote"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/security/advisories/GHSA-58vr-c56v-qr57"], "commits": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/commit/796617e0131277011207541313522cd1946661ab"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["discourse-plugin"], "langs": {"Ruby": 463}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 12, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
