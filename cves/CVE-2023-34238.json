The Gatsby framework prior to versions 4.25.7 and 5.9.1 contain a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the `__file-code-frame` and `__original-stack-frame` paths, exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`). Any file in scope of the development server could potentially be exposed. It should be noted that by default `gatsby develop` is only accessible via the localhost `127.0.0.1`, and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as `--host 0.0.0.0`, `-H 0.0.0.0`, or the `GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable. A patch has been introduced in `gatsby@5.9.1` and `gatsby@4.25.7` which mitigates the issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid exposing their development server to the internet."], "published": "2023-06-08T00:15:09.907", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gatsbyjs"], "productName": ["gatsby"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/security/advisories/GHSA-c6f8-8r25-c4gc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/ae5a654eb346b2e7a9d341b809b2f82d34c0f17c", "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/fc22f4ba3ad7ca5fb3592f38f4f0ca8ae60b4bf7"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog", "compiler", "gatsby", "graphql", "react", "static-site-generator", "web-app"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 5322406, "TypeScript": 3485100, "CSS": 94587, "HTML": 62235, "MDX": 40139, "Shell": 11157, "Dockerfile": 2751, "PHP": 2010, "EJS": 461, "Python": 281, "Less": 218, "SCSS": 218, "Stylus": 206}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12551863?v=4", "stargazers": 55799, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
