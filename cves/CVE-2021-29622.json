In 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /. Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint. If a user visits a prometheus server with a specially crafted address, they can be redirected to an arbitrary URL. The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases. In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely. The workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of Prometheus."], "published": "2021-05-19T20:15:07.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["prometheus"], "productName": ["prometheus"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/security/advisories/GHSA-vx57-7f4q-fpc7"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["alerting", "graphing", "hacktoberfest", "metrics", "monitoring", "prometheus", "time-series"], "langs": {"Go": 7504816, "TypeScript": 1138772, "Yacc": 36276, "SCSS": 18605, "Shell": 17929, "CSS": 11834, "JavaScript": 9529, "Makefile": 6812, "Lex": 6493, "HTML": 4562, "Dockerfile": 956}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3380462?v=4", "stargazers": 58022, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
