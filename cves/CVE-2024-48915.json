Prior to version 1.0.0-dev.29, certificate verification in `lib/agent/certificate.dart` does not occur properly. During the delegation verification in the `_checkDelegation` function, the canister_ranges aren't verified. The impact of not checking the canister_ranges is that a subnet can sign canister responses in behalf of another subnet. The certificateâ€™s timestamp, i.e /time path, is also not verified, meaning that the certificate effectively has no expiration time. Version 1.0.0-dev.29 implements appropriate certificate verification."], "published": "2024-10-15T17:15:11.943", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["AstroxNetwork"], "productName": ["agent_dart"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/security/advisories/GHSA-fmj7-7gfw-64pg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/commit/0d200686aabcd9313c7bc3e675cbdc82f6b775cf"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dart", "dfinity", "ffi", "flutter", "internet-computer", "rust"], "langs": {"Dart": 783932, "Rust": 661863, "CMake": 24740, "C++": 20968, "Ruby": 6687, "Shell": 4462, "Batchfile": 2441, "C": 1559, "Swift": 1158, "PowerShell": 695, "Kotlin": 153, "Objective-C": 38}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84609221?v=4", "stargazers": 107, "language": "Dart"}}, "pocList": []}
