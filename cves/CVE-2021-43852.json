In affected versions by sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. Later this injection may lead to JS code execution by libraries that are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.8. Users unable to upgrade may configure a firewall to drop requests containing next strings: `__proto__` , `constructor[prototype]`, and `constructor.prototype` to mitigate this issue."], "published": "2022-01-04T20:15:07.730", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["oroinc"], "productName": ["platform"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/oroinc/platform/security/advisories/GHSA-jx5q-g37m-h5hj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/oroinc/platform/commit/62c26936b3adee9c20255dcd9f8ee5c299b464a9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/oroinc/platform/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["b2b", "oroplatform", "php", "symfony"], "langs": {"PHP": 58725043, "JavaScript": 5124088, "Twig": 1317773, "SCSS": 1028351, "Gherkin": 509389, "HTML": 145303, "CSS": 11749}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4165718?v=4", "stargazers": 636, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
