Prior to version 2.5.1, authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (User or Admin), can exploit a new line injection in the configuration edition feature (e.g. mail settings) and gain arbitrary code execution on the server. This issue was addressed in version 2.5.1 by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of new lines characters in new configuration values. As a workaround, only allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard."], "published": "2021-08-27T23:15:06.900", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fiveai"], "productName": ["Cachet"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxw-cfrh-jxq6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 3546924, "Blade": 238979, "JavaScript": 15477, "Vue": 13500, "Shell": 657}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22819349?v=4", "stargazers": 101, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/W1ngLess/CVE-2021-39172-RCE", "https://github.com/W1ngLess/CVE-2021-39172-RCE"]}
