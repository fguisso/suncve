Due to the wide cutout of the enclosures, the JTAG port can be accessed without having to open the disk enclosure. Utilizing the JTAG debug port, an attacker with (temporary) physical access can get full access to the firmware and memory on the 2 main CPU cores within the drive including the execution of arbitrary code, the modification of firmware execution flow and data or bypassing the firmware signature verification during boot-up."], "published": "2024-12-20T11:15:08.720", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Kioxia"], "productName": ["CM6", "PM7", "PM6"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-3hh8-94j4-62rh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-3hh8-94j4-62rh", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/google/security-research/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 3261224, "Python": 153144, "Shell": 123520, "Go": 122474, "TypeScript": 84926, "Makefile": 59334, "Assembly": 49813, "Java": 31234, "CSS": 23622, "CodeQL": 18092, "Dockerfile": 13547, "HTML": 6938, "C++": 6653, "JavaScript": 3944, "GDB": 811, "PHP": 556}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342004?v=4", "stargazers": 3851, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
