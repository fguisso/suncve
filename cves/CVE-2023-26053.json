This is a collision attack on long IDs (64bits) for PGP keys. Users of dependency verification in Gradle are vulnerable if they use long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in their dependency verification metadata file. The fix is to fail dependency verification if anything but a fingerprint is used in a trust element in dependency verification metadata. The problem is fixed in Gradle 8.0 and above. The problem is also patched in Gradle 6.9.4 and 7.6.1. As a workaround, use only full fingerprint IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in the metadata is a protection against this issue."], "published": "2023-03-02T04:15:11.147", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gradle"], "productName": ["gradle"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-c724-3xg7-g3hf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/bf3cc0f2b463033037e67aaacda31291643ea1a9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["build-tool", "good-first-issue", "gradle", "gradle-bt", "groovy", "hacktoberfest", "java", "kotlin"], "langs": {"Groovy": 35448451, "Java": 33075975, "Kotlin": 5361544, "C++": 888505, "JavaScript": 77171, "HTML": 15779, "CSS": 14873, "Shell": 12290, "XSLT": 7121, "C": 5785, "Scala": 2817, "Gherkin": 192, "Python": 58, "Brainfuck": 54}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124156?v=4", "stargazers": 17467, "language": "Groovy"}}, "pocList": []}
