Prior to version 1.4.4, a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in either of the following ways: allow both \"math\" and \"style\" elements,  or allow both \"svg\" and \"style\" elements. Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden. . This issue is fixed in version 1.4.4. All users overriding the allowed tags to include \"math\" or \"svg\" and \"style\" should either upgrade or use the following workaround immediately: Remove \"style\" from the overridden allowed tags, or remove \"math\" and \"svg\" from the overridden allowed tags.\n"], "published": "2022-12-14T17:15:11.067", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rails"], "productName": ["rails-html-sanitizer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-9h9g-93gc-623h"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 84358}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4223?v=4", "stargazers": 318, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
