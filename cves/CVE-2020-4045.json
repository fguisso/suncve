The get() method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly ask it to, but there is a bug where it's decrypting any message that it can. This means that it is returning the decrypted content of private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around get() to anonymous peers. This is fixed in version 20.0.1. Note that users of SSB-Server verion 16.0.0 should upgrade to 16.0.1 to get the fixed version of SSB-DB."], "published": "2020-06-11T22:15:10.083", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ssbc"], "productName": ["SSB-DB"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/security/advisories/GHSA-mpgr-2cx9-327h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/commit/43334d0871c9cc6220e0f6d6338499060f7761d4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 129499}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10190339?v=4", "stargazers": 1175, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
