The ChecksumCalculator class within allows for hashing and checksum generation, but it includes or defaults to algorithms that are no longer recommended for secure cryptographic use cases (e.g., SHA-1, CRC32, and SSDEEP). These algorithms, while possibly valid for certain non-security-critical tasks, can expose users to security risks if used in scenarios where strong cryptographic guarantees are required. This issue is fixed in 8.24.0."], "published": "2025-03-05T22:15:35.867", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["NationalSecurityAgency"], "productName": ["emissary"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/security/advisories/GHSA-hw43-fcmm-3m5g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/commit/da3a81a8977577597ff2a944820a5ae4e9762368"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/security/advisories/GHSA-hw43-fcmm-3m5g", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 3623776, "Shell": 12574, "Mustache": 8795, "Dockerfile": 4076, "CSS": 1970, "JavaScript": 1922, "Smarty": 1792, "HTML": 1194}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11298292?v=4", "stargazers": 256, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
