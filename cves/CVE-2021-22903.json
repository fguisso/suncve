Specially crafted Host headers in combination with certain \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. This is similar to CVE-2021-22881. Strings in config.hosts that do not have a leading dot are converted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This causes, for example, `config.hosts << \"sub.example.com\"` to permit a request with a Host header value of `sub-example.com`."], "published": "2021-06-11T16:15:11.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["https://github.com/rails/rails"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
