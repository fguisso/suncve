The 'enc_untrusted_recvfrom' function generates a return value which is deserialized by 'MessageReader', and copied into three different 'extents'. The length of the third 'extents' is controlled by the outside world, and not verified on copy, allowing the attacker to force Asylo to copy trusted memory data into an untrusted buffer of significantly small length.. We recommend updating Asylo to version 0.6.0 or later."], "published": "2020-08-12T19:15:14.670", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Google LLC"], "productName": ["Asylo"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/299f804acbb95a612ab7c504d25ab908aa59ae93"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/google/asylo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C++": 5876707, "Starlark": 708214, "C": 120094, "Python": 46063, "Shell": 43678, "Smarty": 41243, "Java": 23045, "Dockerfile": 2666, "HTML": 2522}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342004?v=4", "stargazers": 973, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
