Specifically, when the Vert.x HTTP client establishes connections to different hosts, triggering the memory leak. The leak can be accelerated with intimate runtime knowledge, allowing an attacker to exploit this vulnerability. For instance, a server accepting arbitrary internet addresses could serve as an attack vector by connecting to these addresses, thereby accelerating the memory leak."], "published": "2024-03-27T08:15:38.140", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["CEQ 3.2", "Cryostat 2 on RHEL 8", "MTA-6.2-RHEL-9", "Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.7.0", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.1 for Spring Boot", "Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.2.11.Final", "RHINT Service Registry 2.5.11 GA", "A-MQ Clients 2", "Migration Toolkit for Runtimes", "OpenShift Serverless", "Red Hat AMQ Broker 7", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel for Spring Boot 3", "Red Hat Build of Keycloak", "Red Hat build of OptaPlanner 8", "Red Hat build of Quarkus", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Fuse 7", "Red Hat Integration Camel K", "Red Hat Integration Camel Quarkus", "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack", "Red Hat Process Automation 7"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
