In livewire/livewire prior to `2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension. If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack: 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files. This issue has been addressed in release versions `2.12.7` and `3.5.2`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-10-08T18:15:31.370", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["livewire"], "productName": ["livewire"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/livewire/livewire/security/advisories/GHSA-f3cx-396f-7jqp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/70503b79f5db75a1eac9bf55826038a6ee5a16d5", "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/cd168c6212ea13d13b82b3132485741f82d9fad9"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/security/advisories/GHSA-f3cx-396f-7jqp", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 1610276, "JavaScript": 169272, "Blade": 65831, "Shell": 680}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51960834?v=4", "stargazers": 22804, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
