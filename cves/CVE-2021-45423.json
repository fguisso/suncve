The array offsets_to_Names is dynamically allocated on the stack using exp->NumberOfFunctions as its size. However, the loop uses exp->NumberOfNames to iterate over it and set its components value. Therefore, the loop code assumes that exp->NumberOfFunctions is greater than ordinal at each iteration.
