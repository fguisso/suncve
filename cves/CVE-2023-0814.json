This is due to insufficient restriction on sensitive user meta values that can be called via that shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions, and above to retrieve sensitive user meta that can be used to gain access to a high privileged user account. This does require the Usermeta shortcode be enabled to be exploited."], "published": "2023-02-14T02:15:10.453", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["reflectionmedia"], "productName": ["Profile Builder – User Profile & User Registration Forms"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
