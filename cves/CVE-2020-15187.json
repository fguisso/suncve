If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution attack. To perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been patched in Helm 2.16.11 and Helm 3.3.2. As a possible workaround make sure to install plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL."], "published": "2020-09-17T22:15:12.647", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["helm"], "productName": ["helm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-c52f-pq47-2r9j"], "commits": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/d9ef5ce8bad512e325390c0011be1244b8380e4b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/helm/helm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["chart", "charts", "cncf", "helm", "kubernetes"], "langs": {"Go": 2008774, "Shell": 30899, "Makefile": 8750}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15859888?v=4", "stargazers": 27695, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
