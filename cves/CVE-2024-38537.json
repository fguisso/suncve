Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard."], "published": "2024-07-02T20:15:05.860", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ethyca"], "productName": ["fides"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-cvw4-c69g-7v7m"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/868c4d629760572192bd61db34f5a4458ed12005"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data", "data-privacy", "data-privacy-compliance", "developer-tools", "gdpr", "hacktoberfest", "privacy-as-code", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 7660018, "TypeScript": 5051484, "JavaScript": 365464, "CSS": 39118, "HTML": 33307, "SCSS": 18712, "Dockerfile": 4481, "Jinja": 3618, "Mako": 494}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50628321?v=4", "stargazers": 392, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Havoc10-sw/Detect_polyfill_CVE-2024-38537-", "https://github.com/Havoc10-sw/Detect_polyfill_CVE-2024-38537-"]}
