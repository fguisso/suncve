When parsing form data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \\r or LF \\n) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18."], "published": "2024-12-02T16:15:14.457", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Kludex"], "productName": ["python-multipart"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/security/advisories/GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/commit/c4fe4d3cebc08c660e57dd709af1ffa7059b3177"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 140938, "Shell": 476}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7353520?v=4", "stargazers": 385, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
