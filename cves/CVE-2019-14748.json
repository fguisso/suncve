The Ticket creation form allows users to upload files along with queries. It was found that the file-upload functionality has fewer (or no) mitigations implemented for file content checks; also, the output is not handled properly, causing persistent XSS that leads to cookie stealing or malicious actions. For example, a non-agent user can upload a .html file, and Content-Disposition will be set to inline instead of attachment."], "published": "2019-08-07T17:15:12.417", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/commit/33ed106b1602f559a660a69f931a9d873685d1ba"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 6175939, "JavaScript": 360530, "CSS": 239335, "Less": 15079, "Shell": 4233, "Perl": 2087, "HTML": 882, "Standard ML": 33}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/371413?v=4", "stargazers": 3368, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
