In Admidio before version 4.3.9, there is an SQL Injection in the `/adm_program/modules/ecards/ecard_send.php` source file of the Admidio Application. The SQL Injection results in a compromise of the application's database. The value of `ecard_recipients `POST parameter is being directly concatenated with the SQL query in the source code causing the SQL Injection. The SQL Injection can be exploited by a member user, using blind condition-based, time-based, and Out of band interaction SQL Injection payloads. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.3.9."], "published": "2024-07-29T15:15:10.747", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Admidio"], "productName": ["admidio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-69wx-xc6j-28v3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/commit/3ff02b0c64a6911ab3e81cd61077f392c0b25248"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-69wx-xc6j-28v3", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept", "steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admidio", "club-management", "documents-manager", "event-management", "lists", "members", "membership", "membership-management", "organization", "photo-album", "php", "user-management"], "langs": {"PHP": 3535695, "JavaScript": 806343, "Smarty": 277323, "CSS": 90577, "HTML": 36415, "Shell": 12215, "Dockerfile": 3454}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9728353?v=4", "stargazers": 369, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
