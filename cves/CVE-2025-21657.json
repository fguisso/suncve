The rq_lock() is supposed to be used\nfor online CPUs, and the use of rq_lock() may trigger an unnecessary\nwarning in rq_pin_lock(). Therefore, replace rq_lock() to\nraw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass().\n\nWithout this change, we observe the following warning:\n\n===== START =====\n[    6.615205] rq->balance_callback && rq->balance_callback != &balance_push_callback\n[    6.615208] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at kernel/sched/sched.h:1730 __schedule+0x1130/0x1c90\n=====  END  ====="], "published": "2025-01-21T13:15:09.340", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
