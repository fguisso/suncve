Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command structure may have the wrong command executed. If a user sends a request to a org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary with a space in its name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one. This issue was patched in version 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16 and 12.0.0-beta2.\n"], "published": "2023-09-15T19:15:08.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["eclipse"], "productName": ["jetty.project"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-3gh6-v5v9-6v9j"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["eclipse", "embedded", "fcgi", "http", "http-client", "http-server", "http2", "http2-push", "http3", "https", "jakartaee", "java", "jetty", "jsp", "osgi", "servlet", "ssl", "tls", "unix-socket", "websockets"], "langs": {"Java": 36213570, "JavaScript": 171477, "HTML": 143105, "AMPL": 142108, "Groovy": 48831, "Shell": 31096, "CSS": 24387, "XSLT": 2658}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143739000?v=4", "stargazers": 3908, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
