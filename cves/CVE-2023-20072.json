This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of large fragmented tunnel protocol packets. One example of a tunnel protocol is Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted fragmented packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-03-23T17:15:14.727", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XE Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
