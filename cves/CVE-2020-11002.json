A server-side template injection was identified in the self-validating feature enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. If you are using a self-validating bean an upgrade to Dropwizard 1.3.21/2.0.3 or later is strongly recommended. The changes introduced in Dropwizard 1.3.19 and 2.0.2 for CVE-2020-5245 unfortunately did not fix the underlying issue completely. The issue has been fixed in dropwizard-validation 1.3.21 and 2.0.3 or later. We strongly recommend upgrading to one of these versions."], "published": "2020-04-10T19:15:13.007", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dropwizard"], "productName": ["dropwizard"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/security/advisories/GHSA-8jpx-m2wh-2v34", "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/security/advisories/GHSA-3mcp-9wr4-cjqf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/commit/d5a512f7abf965275f2a6b913ac4fe778e424242"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dropwizard", "hibernate", "java", "jax-rs", "jdbi", "jersey-framework", "jersey2", "jetty", "rest", "restful-webservices", "web-framework"], "langs": {"Java": 2835962, "Shell": 1642, "FreeMarker": 992, "Mustache": 569, "HTML": 111}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5478557?v=4", "stargazers": 8529, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
