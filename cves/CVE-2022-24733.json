Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible for a page controlled by an attacker to load the website within an iframe. This will enable a clickjacking attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. Every response from app should have an X-Frame-Options header set to: ``sameorigin``. To achieve that, add a new `subscriber` in the app."], "published": "2022-03-14T19:15:12.173", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Sylius"], "productName": ["Sylius"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/security/advisories/GHSA-4jp3-q2qm-9fmw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "api-ecommerce", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-platform", "framework", "hacktoberfest", "headless", "headless-ecommerce", "php", "rest-api", "restful-api", "shop", "shopping-cart", "sylius", "symfony", "symfony-bundle"], "langs": {"PHP": 10625965, "Gherkin": 1521463, "Twig": 578345, "SCSS": 46356, "JavaScript": 37590, "Dockerfile": 4882, "Shell": 1935, "Makefile": 1440}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/719423?v=4", "stargazers": 8170, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
