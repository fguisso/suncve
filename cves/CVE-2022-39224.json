Versions prior to 0.0.12 are subject to OS command injection resulting in shell execution if the RPM contains a malicious \"payload compressor\" field. This vulnerability impacts the `extract` and `files` methods of the `RPM::File` class of this library. Version 0.0.12 patches these issues. A workaround for this issue is to ensure any RPMs being processed contain valid/known payload compressor values such as gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd, and lzma. The payload compressor field in an rpm can be checked by using the rpm command line tool."], "published": "2022-09-21T23:15:09.623", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jordansissel"], "productName": ["ruby-arr-pm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/security/advisories/GHSA-88cv-mj24-8w3q"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 44878, "Makefile": 564}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131818?v=4", "stargazers": 18, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
