These vulnerabilities are due to missing checks when the IP cameras process a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP camera or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent)."], "published": "2020-08-26T17:15:14.380", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
