This vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function, allowing an attacker to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious actors could exploit this race condition. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2024-10-10T23:15:03.070", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gradio-app"], "productName": ["gradio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-xh2x-3mrm-fwqm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-analysis", "data-science", "data-visualization", "deep-learning", "deploy", "gradio", "gradio-interface", "hacktoberfest", "interface", "machine-learning", "models", "python", "python-notebook", "ui", "ui-components"], "langs": {"Python": 3243620, "Svelte": 1268769, "TypeScript": 1046794, "mdsvex": 217599, "CSS": 72732, "JavaScript": 62299, "Jupyter Notebook": 32113, "HTML": 22988, "Batchfile": 6427, "Shell": 6015, "MDX": 1670, "Dockerfile": 128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51063788?v=4", "stargazers": 37296, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
