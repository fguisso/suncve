A remote attacker with network access to the proxy server could leverage this vulnerability to connect to VNC servers protected by the proxy server without providing any authentication credentials. Exploitation of this issue requires that the proxy server is currently accepting connections for the target VNC server."], "published": "2022-09-14T11:15:49.567", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/osuosl/twisted_vncauthproxy/commit/edc149af29242178091b2d6fcd42c3ef0851644b"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/osuosl/twisted_vncauthproxy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 38069}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380625?v=4", "stargazers": 7, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
