This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue."], "published": "2022-07-01T08:15:07.687", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenSSL"], "productName": ["OpenSSL"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Malwareman007/CVE-2022-2274", "https://github.com/EkamSinghWalia/OpenSSL-Vulnerability-Detection-Script", "https://github.com/DesmondSanctity/CVE-2022-2274", "https://github.com/Malwareman007/CVE-2022-2274", "https://github.com/EkamSinghWalia/OpenSSL-Vulnerability-Detection-Script", "https://github.com/DesmondSanctity/CVE-2022-2274"]}
