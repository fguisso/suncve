MITRE classifies this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private package dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to a well-known public repository such as PyPi. The configuration has been updated to only install components built by Antilles, removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools dependency has been published to PyPi."], "published": "2021-11-12T22:15:08.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Antilles"], "productName": ["Antilles"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/lenovo/Antilles/security/advisories/GHSA-hgc3-hp6x-wpgx"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/lenovo/Antilles/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1907724, "Python": 1187701, "Vue": 761156, "CSS": 61255, "HTML": 42561, "C": 25660, "Shell": 17648, "Cython": 777}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13356730?v=4", "stargazers": 18, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
