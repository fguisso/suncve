Due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug in versions 2.6 through 2.7.STABLE9, versions 3.1 through 5.9, and versions 6.0.1 through 6.5, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Request parsing. This problem allows a remote client to perform Denial of Service attack by sending a large X-Forwarded-For header when the follow_x_forwarded_for feature is configured. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives."], "published": "2023-12-14T18:15:45.070", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["squid-cache"], "productName": ["squid"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-wgq4-4cfg-c4x3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ecap", "ftp", "http", "https", "icap", "proxy"], "langs": {"C++": 7946772, "C": 709097, "M4": 223219, "Makefile": 141206, "Perl": 119339, "Shell": 98823, "Roff": 70681, "Awk": 7112, "HTML": 2381, "CSS": 1791, "sed": 311}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/363029?v=4", "stargazers": 2438, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
