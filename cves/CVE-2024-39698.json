The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows. Because of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found in command-line above. This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid. This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.). The patch is available starting from 6.3.0-alpha.6."], "published": "2024-07-09T18:15:10.863", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["electron-userland"], "productName": ["electron-builder"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxc-qjr9-vjxq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/commit/ac2e6a25aa491c1ef5167a552c19fc2085cd427f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["appx", "auto-update", "builder", "contributions-welcome", "deb", "distribution-electron", "dmg", "electron", "electron-builder", "electron-updater", "help-wanted", "linux", "macos", "msi", "muon", "nsis", "pkg", "rpm", "snap", "squirrel"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1362850, "NSIS": 92823, "JavaScript": 24348, "Shell": 6968, "Dockerfile": 5249, "Smarty": 369, "CSS": 264}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17519142?v=4", "stargazers": 13968, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
