Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`."], "published": "2022-07-11T21:15:08.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kubeedge"], "productName": ["kubeedge"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-qpx3-9565-5xwm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-native", "cncf", "container", "device-management", "docker", "edge-computing", "golang", "iot", "kubernetes", "mosquitto", "mqtt"], "langs": {"Go": 3878482, "Shell": 200453, "Makefile": 14265, "Dockerfile": 9882, "Mustache": 1288}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41812520?v=4", "stargazers": 6996, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
