Since 0.3.4, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string. In a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, where the \"number\" part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.6."], "published": "2024-07-09T15:15:11.290", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["whisperfish"], "productName": ["rust-phonenumber"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/security/advisories/GHSA-mjw4-jj88-v687"], "commits": ["https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/b792151b17fc90231c232a23935830c2266f3203", "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/f69abee1481fac0d6d531407bae90020e39c6407"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["formatter", "parser", "phone-number", "rust", "rust-library", "validator"], "langs": {"Rust": 159572, "Shell": 502}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82575565?v=4", "stargazers": 170, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
