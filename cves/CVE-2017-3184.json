An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the http://x.x.x.x/setup/setup_maintain_firmware-default.html page. This will allow an attacker to perform a factory reset on the device, leading to a denial of service condition or the ability to make use of default credentials (CVE-2017-3186)."], "published": "2017-12-16T02:29:10.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ACTi Corporation"], "productName": ["ACTi D, B, I, and E series cameras"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
