This permits a maliciously crafted input containing very long lines to cause allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion. With fix, the ParseMultipartForm function now correctly limits the maximum size of form lines."], "published": "2024-03-05T23:15:07.210", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Go standard library"], "productName": ["net/textproto"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
