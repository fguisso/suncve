In DBdeployer before version 1.58.2, users unpacking a tarball may use a maliciously packaged tarball that contains symlinks to files external to the target. In such scenario, an attacker could induce dbdeployer to write into a system file, thus altering the computer defenses. For the attack to succeed, the following factors need to contribute: 1) The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it was designed to run as unprivileged user. 2) The user has taken a tarball from a non secure source, without testing the checksum. When the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer, the checksum is compared before attempting to unpack. This has been fixed in version 1.58.2."], "published": "2020-12-21T22:15:13.317", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["datacharmer"], "productName": ["dbdeployer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer/security/advisories/GHSA-47wr-426j-fr82"], "commits": ["https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer/commit/548e256c1de2f99746e861454e7714ec6bc9bb10"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["deployment", "multi-server", "mysql", "replication", "sandbox", "server", "tarball", "testing-tools"], "langs": {"Go": 842652, "Shell": 186765}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347371?v=4", "stargazers": 710, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
