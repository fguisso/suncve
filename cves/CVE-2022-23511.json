When users trigger a repair of the Agent, a pop-up window opens with SYSTEM permissions. Users with administrative access to affected hosts may use this to create a new command prompt as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. To trigger this issue, the third party must be able to access the affected host and elevate their privileges such that they're able to trigger the agent repair process. They must also be able to install the tools required to trigger the issue. This issue does not affect the CloudWatch Agent for macOS or Linux. Agent users should upgrade to version 1.247355 of the CloudWatch Agent to address this issue. There is no recommended work around. Affected users must update the installed version of the CloudWatch Agent to address this issue."], "published": "2022-12-12T13:15:12.120", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aws"], "productName": ["amazon-cloudwatch-agent"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-j8x2-2m5w-j939"], "commits": ["https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/commit/6119858864c317ff26f41f576c169148d1250837#diff-76ed074a9305c04054cdebb9e9aad2d818052b07091de1f20cad0bbac34ffb52"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 3430981, "Shell": 39083, "Makefile": 24143, "PowerShell": 18892, "Dockerfile": 4206}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2232217?v=4", "stargazers": 470, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
