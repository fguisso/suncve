Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A low-privileged OS user with access to a Windows host where Cacti is installed can create arbitrary PHP files in a web document directory. The user can then execute the PHP files under the security context of SYSTEM. This allows an attacker to escalate privilege from a normal user account to SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"], "published": "2023-09-05T22:15:08.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cacti"], "productName": ["cacti"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-rf5w-pq3f-9876"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-rf5w-pq3f-9876", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cacti", "cacti-community", "cacti-framework", "data-gathering", "graph", "graph-templating", "network-discovery", "php", "rrd-files", "rrdtool"], "langs": {"PHP": 7014030, "JavaScript": 2536428, "CSS": 1220532, "SCSS": 255696, "Less": 246030, "Shell": 51723, "Perl": 7357, "HTML": 5179, "Ruby": 2138}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142645?v=4", "stargazers": 1710, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
