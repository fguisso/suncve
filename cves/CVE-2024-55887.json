In versions prior to 1.0.9, XML parsing performed by the UcumEssenceService is vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where ucum is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. Release 1.0.9 of Ucum-java fixes this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that the source xml for instantiating UcumEssenceService is trusted."], "published": "2024-12-13T16:15:28.063", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FHIR"], "productName": ["Ucum-java"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/FHIR/Ucum-java/security/advisories/GHSA-w9j7-phm3-f97j"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/FHIR/Ucum-java/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 247820}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6048542?v=4", "stargazers": 24, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
