The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an affected device with the goal of reaching the vulnerable section of the input buffer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected."], "published": "2020-08-17T18:15:13.883", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
