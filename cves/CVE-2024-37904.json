Minder's Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First, it sets the `CloneOptions`, specifying the url, the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem, to which it clones and Finally, it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack: A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions: 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones, 2. Minder does not enforce a size limit to the repository, 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-06-18T17:15:52.337", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stacklok"], "productName": ["minder"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/GHSA-hpcg-xjq5-g666"], "commits": ["https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/7979b43"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/GHSA-hpcg-xjq5-g666", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["security", "software-supply-chain", "software-supply-chain-security", "supply-chain"], "langs": {"Go": 3987338, "PLpgSQL": 125512, "Makefile": 14093, "HTML": 2450, "Shell": 1410, "Smarty": 538, "CSS": 429, "Dockerfile": 220}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183659722?v=4", "stargazers": 327, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
