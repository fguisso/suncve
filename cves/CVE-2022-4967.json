When certificates are used to authenticate clients in TLS-based EAP methods, the IKE or EAP identity supplied by a client is not enforced to be contained in the client's certificate. So clients can authenticate with any trusted certificate and claim an arbitrary IKE/EAP identity as their own. This is problematic if the identity is used to make policy decisions. A fix was released in strongSwan version 5.9.6 in August 2022 (e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136)."], "published": "2024-05-14T11:57:00.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["strongSwan"], "productName": ["strongSwan"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ikev2", "ipsec", "strongswan", "vpn", "vpn-client", "vpn-server"], "langs": {"C": 16364400, "Roff": 1764643, "Shell": 730560, "Java": 524171, "Makefile": 241664, "M4": 97012, "Python": 53488, "Objective-C": 35366, "Perl": 23568, "Ruby": 18205, "C#": 16172, "Yacc": 13707, "Lex": 10296, "Ada": 7497, "CSS": 2963, "Smalltalk": 2535, "Dockerfile": 2445, "HTML": 1392, "Rich Text Format": 1389, "JavaScript": 209}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457671?v=4", "stargazers": 2428, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
