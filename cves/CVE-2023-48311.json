Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable docker image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended. This issue has been addressed in commit `3ba4b665b` which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior."], "published": "2023-12-08T20:15:07.573", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jupyterhub"], "productName": ["dockerspawner"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/security/advisories/GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/commit/3ba4b665b6ca6027ea7a032d7ca3eab977574626"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["docker-container", "dockerspawner", "jupyter", "jupyterhub", "spawn-notebook-servers", "spawner"], "langs": {"Python": 98890, "Shell": 744}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17927519?v=4", "stargazers": 512, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
