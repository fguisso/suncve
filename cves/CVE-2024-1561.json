Specifically, by exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()` method of the `Block` class, an attacker can copy any file on the filesystem to a temporary directory and subsequently retrieve it. This vulnerability enables unauthorized local file read access, posing a significant risk especially when the application is exposed to the internet via `launch(share=True)`, thereby allowing remote attackers to read files on the host machine. Furthermore, gradio apps hosted on `huggingface.co` are also affected, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables."], "published": "2024-04-16T00:15:08.887", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gradio-app"], "productName": ["gradio-app/gradio"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/24a583688046867ca8b8b02959c441818bdb34a2"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-analysis", "data-science", "data-visualization", "deep-learning", "deploy", "gradio", "gradio-interface", "hacktoberfest", "interface", "machine-learning", "models", "python", "python-notebook", "ui", "ui-components"], "langs": {"Python": 3243620, "Svelte": 1268769, "TypeScript": 1046794, "mdsvex": 217599, "CSS": 72732, "JavaScript": 62299, "Jupyter Notebook": 32113, "HTML": 22988, "Batchfile": 6427, "Shell": 6015, "MDX": 1670, "Dockerfile": 128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51063788?v=4", "stargazers": 37296, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/DiabloHTB/CVE-2024-1561", "https://github.com/DiabloHTB/Nuclei-Template-CVE-2024-1561", "https://github.com/DiabloHTB/CVE-2024-1561", "https://github.com/DiabloHTB/Nuclei-Template-CVE-2024-1561"]}
