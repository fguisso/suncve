Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.9 and Opencast 8.8 Please be aware that fixing the problem means that Opencast will not simply accept any self-signed certificates any longer without properly importing them. If you need those, please make sure to import them into the Java key store. Better yet, get a valid certificate."], "published": "2020-12-08T23:15:12.060", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["opencast"], "productName": ["opencast"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-44cw-p2hm-gpf6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/4225bf90af74557deaf8fb6b80b0705c9621acfc"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["capture-screen", "capture-video", "hacktoberfest", "opencast", "recording", "video", "video-management", "video-processing", "video-production", "video-publication"], "langs": {"Java": 15160448, "JavaScript": 1605993, "CSS": 67523, "TypeScript": 56924, "HTML": 28931, "XSLT": 6086, "Python": 5012, "Shell": 4057, "ANTLR": 661}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5639632?v=4", "stargazers": 425, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
