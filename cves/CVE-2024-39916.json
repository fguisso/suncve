There is a security issue with the NFS configuration in /etc/exports generated by the installer that allows an attacker to modify files outside the export in the default installation. The exports have the no_subtree_check option. The no_subtree_check option means that if a client performs a file operation, the server will only check if the requested file is on the correct filesystem, not if it is in the correct directory. This enables modifying files in /images, accessing other files on the same filesystem, and accessing files on other filesystems. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.10.30."], "published": "2024-07-12T15:15:11.813", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FOGProject"], "productName": ["fogproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-3xjr-xf9v-hwjh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/2de209bc57a177a052b4a877f000c591740b2f88"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-3xjr-xf9v-hwjh", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 3148340, "JavaScript": 610300, "Shell": 240490, "Makefile": 91239, "SCSS": 79489, "Less": 78481, "CSS": 45725, "C": 19398, "HTML": 2693, "Awk": 375}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9626396?v=4", "stargazers": 1240, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
