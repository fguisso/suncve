Versions before and including `1.4.1` are vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing an XSS payload in the `error` query parameter which is then processed by the callback handler as an error message. You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` version `1.4.1` or lower **unless** you are using custom error handling that does not return the error message in an HTML response. Upgrade to version `1.4.1` to resolve. The fix adds basic HTML escaping to the error message and it should not impact your users."], "published": "2021-06-25T17:15:08.383", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["auth0"], "productName": ["nextjs-auth0"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-954c-jjx6-cxv7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/commit/6996e2528ceed98627caa28abafbc09e90163ccf"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["auth0", "dx-sdk", "nextjs", "react", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 365416, "JavaScript": 2456, "CSS": 690}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2824157?v=4", "stargazers": 2161, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
