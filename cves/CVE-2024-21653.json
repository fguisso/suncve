Nodes and servers get a ssh config by default that permits root login with password authentication. In a proper deployment, the SSH service is not exposed so there is no risk, but not all deployments are ideal. The default should therefore be less permissive.  The vulnerability can be mitigated by removing the ssh part from the docker file and rebuilding the docker image.  Version 4.2.0 patches the vulnerability."], "published": "2024-01-30T16:15:47.863", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vantage6"], "productName": ["vantage6"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-2wgc-48g2-cj5w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/commit/3fcc6e6a8bd1142fd7a558d8fdd2b246e55c8841"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 2000752, "TypeScript": 630932, "HTML": 228746, "SCSS": 25580, "Makefile": 13676, "Dockerfile": 9057, "Jinja": 5970, "Shell": 4282, "JavaScript": 802}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94541125?v=4", "stargazers": 32, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
