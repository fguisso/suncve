Prior to version 1.7.1, several `HandleRoute` endpoints make use of the deprecated `ioutil.ReadAll()`. `ioutil.ReadAll()` reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause denial of service. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo Events version 1.7.1."], "published": "2022-06-13T20:15:07.897", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["argoproj"], "productName": ["argo-events"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/security/advisories/GHSA-5q86-62xr-3r57"], "commits": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/commit/eaabcb6d65022fc34a0cc9ea7f00681abd326b35"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["argo", "automation-framework", "cloud-native", "cloudevents", "event-driven", "event-source", "eventing-framework", "kubernetes", "pipelines", "triggers", "workflow-automation", "workflows"], "langs": {"Go": 1653069, "Shell": 16465, "Makefile": 9200, "Smarty": 3292, "Dockerfile": 1240}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30269780?v=4", "stargazers": 2454, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
