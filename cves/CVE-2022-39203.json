Attackers can specify a specific string of characters, which would confuse the bridge into combining an attacker-owned channel and an existing channel, allowing them to grant themselves permissions in the channel. The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. As a workaround operators may disable dynamic channel joining via `dynamicChannels.enabled` to prevent users from joining new channels, which prevents any new channels being bridged outside of what is already bridged, and what is specified in the config."], "published": "2022-09-13T19:15:13.030", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-appservice-irc"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-xvqg-mv25-rwvw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 859769, "JavaScript": 312888, "CSS": 3243, "Shell": 2167, "Dockerfile": 1168, "HTML": 298}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 477, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
