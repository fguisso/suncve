Versions prior to 2.79.2, 3.29.5, and 4.22.4 are susceptible to a DOM Clobbering vulnerability when bundling scripts with properties from `import.meta` (e.g., `import.meta.url`) in `cjs`/`umd`/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present. Versions 2.79.2, 3.29.5, and 4.22.4  contain a patch for the vulnerability."], "published": "2024-09-23T16:15:06.947", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rollup"], "productName": ["rollup"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rollup/rollup/security/advisories/GHSA-gcx4-mw62-g8wm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rollup/rollup/commit/2ef77c00ec2635d42697cff2c0567ccc8db34fb4", "https://github.com/rollup/rollup/commit/e2552c9e955e0a61f70f508200ee9f752f85a541"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/rollup/rollup/security/advisories/GHSA-gcx4-mw62-g8wm", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/rollup/rollup/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 8276172, "TypeScript": 1109419, "Rust": 204190, "HTML": 5020, "CSS": 37}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12554859?v=4", "stargazers": 25687, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
