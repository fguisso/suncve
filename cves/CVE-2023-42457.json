Starting in the 2.x branch and prior to versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1, when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer, making the server less responsive. Patches are available in `plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1.  Series 1.x is not affected. As a workaround, one may redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++` in one's frontend web server (nginx, Apache).\n"], "published": "2023-09-21T15:15:10.943", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["plone"], "productName": ["plone.rest"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/security/advisories/GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/43b4a7e86206e237e1de5ca3817ed071575882f7", "https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/77846a9842889b24f35e8bedc2e9d461388d3302"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 108505, "Makefile": 1926}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72034?v=4", "stargazers": 11, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
