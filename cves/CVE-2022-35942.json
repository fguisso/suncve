When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1. This affects users who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand."], "published": "2022-08-12T23:15:07.717", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["loopbackio"], "productName": ["loopback-connector-postgresql"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql/security/advisories/GHSA-j259-6c58-9m58"], "commits": ["https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql/commit/d57406c6737692a3a106b58a35406290cddb23e5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "loopback", "loopback4", "nodejs", "postgresql"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 193869, "Shell": 4079, "Makefile": 272}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22173486?v=4", "stargazers": 116, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
