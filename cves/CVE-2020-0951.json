An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute PowerShell commands that would be blocked by WDAC.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker need administrator access on a local machine where PowerShell is running. The attacker could then connect to a PowerShell session and send commands to execute arbitrary code.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how PowerShell commands are validated when WDAC protection is enabled.</p>\n"], "published": "2020-09-11T17:15:15.043", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1909", "Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 2004", "Windows Server version 2004", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "PowerShell 7.0", "PowerShell 7.1"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
