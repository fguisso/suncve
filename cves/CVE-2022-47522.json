This behavior occurs because the specifications do not require an access point to purge its transmit queue before removing a client's pairwise encryption key."], "published": "2023-04-15T02:15:07.290", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/toffeenutt/CVE-2022-47522-PoC", "https://github.com/toffeenutt/CVE-2022-47522-PoC"]}
