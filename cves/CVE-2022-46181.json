Versions prior to 2.2.2 contain an XSS vulnerability that allows authenticated users to upload .html files. An attacker could execute client side scripts **if** another user opened a link. The attacker could potentially take over the account of the user that clicked the link. The Gotify UI won't natively expose such a malicious link, so an attacker has to get the user to open the malicious link in a context outside of Gotify. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.2.2. As a workaround, you can block access to non image files via a reverse proxy in the `./image` directory."], "published": "2022-12-29T19:15:08.810", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gotify"], "productName": ["server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gotify/server/security/advisories/GHSA-xv6x-456v-24xh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gotify/server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "cloud", "free-software", "golang", "gotify", "hosting", "javascript", "notifications", "privacy", "react", "self-hosted", "self-hosting", "selfhosted"], "langs": {"Go": 355214, "TypeScript": 175185, "Makefile": 6001, "HTML": 2376, "Dockerfile": 2017}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36410427?v=4", "stargazers": 12270, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
