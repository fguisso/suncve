Prior to version 1.2.0, a memory leak can be triggered when parsing usernames which can trigger a denial-of-service. The domain portion of a username may be overridden causing an allocated memory area the size of the domain name to be leaked. An attacker can leak memory via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point, potentially causing a denial-of-service. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0."], "published": "2023-02-14T18:15:13.380", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gssapi"], "productName": ["gss-ntlmssp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-mfm4-6g58-jw74"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/8660fb16474054e692a596e9c79670cd4d3954f4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 476794, "M4": 9365, "Makefile": 6335, "Shell": 1817}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63316684?v=4", "stargazers": 31, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
