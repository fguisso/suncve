DNS over HTTPS is not enabled by default, and backends are using plain DNS (Do53) by default.\n\n"], "published": "2024-05-14T15:05:29.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PowerDNS"], "productName": ["DNSdist"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
