The issue lies in the 'get_user_ip()' function in 'class.Common.php' at lines 1044 and 1045, where the presence of the 'X-Forwarded-For' header is checked and used instead of 'REMOTE_ADDR'. This vulnerability allows attackers to perform brute force attacks on user accounts, including the admin account. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.0."], "published": "2024-11-15T11:15:09.213", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["phpipam"], "productName": ["phpipam/phpipam"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/commit/55c2056068be9f1359e967fcff64db6b7f4d00b5"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ip-address", "ipam", "management-system", "network-admin", "network-discovery", "network-visualization", "subnet"], "langs": {"PHP": 4785483, "JavaScript": 290459, "CSS": 18962, "HTML": 159}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12947690?v=4", "stargazers": 2372, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
