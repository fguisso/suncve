A password disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable. The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`) during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry. This issue has been patched in commit `9995950c70` and has been released as v0.70.0. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade."], "published": "2023-02-07T01:15:09.660", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["anchore"], "productName": ["syft"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/anchore/syft/security/advisories/GHSA-jp7v-3587-2956"], "commits": ["https://github.com/anchore/syft/commit/9995950c70e849f9921919faffbfcf46401f71f3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/anchore/syft/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["containers", "cyclonedx", "docker", "go", "golang", "hacktoberfest", "oci", "sbom", "spdx", "static-analysis", "tool"], "langs": {"Go": 4075174, "Lua": 82633, "Shell": 62173, "Python": 40259, "Makefile": 36032, "Dockerfile": 33365, "C#": 10623, "Elixir": 9158, "Ruby": 9083, "Java": 6170, "Erlang": 5108, "C": 4597, "PHP": 1637, "C++": 1017, "Prolog": 764, "Roff": 360, "Rust": 281, "HTML": 132, "Vim Script": 89, "Perl": 5}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16208487?v=4", "stargazers": 6781, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
