The issue is how the FTP client trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning ports, which otherwise would not have been possible."], "published": "2022-08-24T16:15:09.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["python"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/0ab152c6b5d95caa2dc1a30fa96e10258b5f188e"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/python/cpython/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 36258679, "C": 20933037, "C++": 465749, "M4": 259559, "HTML": 188474, "Batchfile": 78535, "Shell": 71242, "Roff": 49943, "Makefile": 36812, "Objective-C": 33055, "Common Lisp": 24579, "PLSQL": 22886, "PowerShell": 20323, "Rich Text Format": 6905, "JavaScript": 4489, "Kotlin": 3800, "Assembly": 2552, "DTrace": 2196, "CSS": 1325, "XSLT": 1174, "CMake": 419, "VBScript": 70}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525981?v=4", "stargazers": 66147, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
