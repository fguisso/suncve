This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform configuration changes on the affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."], "published": "2022-04-06T19:15:08.377", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
