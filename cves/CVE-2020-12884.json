The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options() parses CoAP options that may occur multiple consecutive times in a single packet. While processing the options, packet_data_pptr is accessed after being incremented by option_len without a prior out-of-bounds memory check. The temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is validated for a correct range, but the range valid for temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is derived from the amount of allocated heap memory, not the actual input size. Therefore the check of temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr may be insufficient for safe access to the area pointed to by packet_data_pptr. As a result, access to a memory area outside of the intended boundary of the packet buffer is made."], "published": "2020-06-18T19:15:09.973", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
