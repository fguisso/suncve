An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted DMG file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to leak bytes from any file that may be read by the ClamAV scanning process."], "published": "2023-03-01T08:15:11.980", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Secure Endpoint"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/nokn0wthing/CVE-2023-20052", "https://github.com/cY83rR0H1t/CVE-2023-20052", "https://github.com/nokn0wthing/CVE-2023-20052", "https://github.com/cY83rR0H1t/CVE-2023-20052"]}
