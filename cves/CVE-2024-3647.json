This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This requires the premium version of the plugin to be installed and activated in order to be exploited."], "published": "2024-05-02T17:15:28.397", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["leap13"], "productName": ["Premium Addons for Elementor"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
