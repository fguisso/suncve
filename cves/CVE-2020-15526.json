These TLS security checks are also ignored during monitoring of VMware machines. This would make SQL Monitor vulnerable to potential man-in-the-middle attacks when sending alert notification emails, posting to Slack or posting to webhooks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.1.7."], "published": "2020-07-09T17:15:12.310", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
