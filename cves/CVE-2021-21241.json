It is an is a independently maintained version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. In Flask-Security-Too from version 3.3.0 and before version 3.4.5, the /login and /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authentication token in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protected with a CSRF token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication token. Version 3.4.5 and version 4.0.0 are patched. As a workaround, if you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set the SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to \"0\" (seconds) which should make the token unusable."], "published": "2021-01-11T21:15:13.377", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Flask-Middleware"], "productName": ["flask-security-too"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/security/advisories/GHSA-hh7m-rx4f-4vpv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/61d313150b5f620d0b800896c4f2199005e84b1f", "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/6d50ee9169acf813257c37b75babe9c28e83542a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59131049?v=4", "stargazers": 0, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
