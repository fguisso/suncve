This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."], "published": "2024-10-22T08:15:04.227", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["amu02aftab"], "productName": ["Category and Taxonomy Meta Fields"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
