A poorly implemented SLP wallet or opportunistic attacker could create a seemingly valid NFT1 child token without burning any of the NFT1 Group token type as is required by the NFT1 specification. This is fixed in version 0.27.4."], "published": "2020-07-30T15:15:13.057", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["simpleledger"], "productName": ["slpjs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/security/advisories/GHSA-cc2p-4jhr-xhhx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/commit/290c20e8bff13ac81459d43e54cac232b5e3456c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 237864}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39035102?v=4", "stargazers": 41, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
