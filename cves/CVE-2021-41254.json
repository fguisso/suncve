Users that can create Kubernetes Secrets, Service Accounts and Flux Kustomization objects, could execute commands inside the kustomize-controller container by embedding a shell script in a Kubernetes Secret. This can be used to run `kubectl` commands under the Service Account of kustomize-controller, thus allowing an authenticated Kubernetes user to gain cluster admin privileges. In affected versions multitenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Flux Kustomization objects are affected by this issue. This vulnerability was fixed in kustomize-controller v0.15.0 (included in flux2 v0.18.0) released on 2021-10-08. Starting with v0.15, the kustomize-controller no longer executes shell commands on the container OS and the `kubectl` binary has been removed from the container image. To prevent the creation of Kubernetes Service Accounts with `secrets` in namespaces owned by tenants, a Kubernetes validation webhook such as Gatekeeper OPA or Kyverno can be used."], "published": "2021-11-12T18:15:07.600", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluxcd"], "productName": ["kustomize-controller"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-35rf-v2jv-gfg7"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["gitops-toolkit"], "langs": {"Go": 411023, "Makefile": 8073, "Smarty": 4949, "Shell": 3025, "Dockerfile": 862, "Ruby": 456}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52158677?v=4", "stargazers": 264, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
