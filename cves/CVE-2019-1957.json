The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending renegotiation requests at a high rate. A successful exploit could increase the resource usage on the system, eventually leading to a DoS condition."], "published": "2019-08-08T08:15:12.647", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
