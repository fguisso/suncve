The issue only affects NGINX if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module and the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Additionally, the attack is possible only if an attacker can trigger the processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module.Â  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated."], "published": "2024-08-14T15:15:31.870", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["F5"], "productName": ["NGINX Open Source", "NGINX Plus"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
