The vulnerability is due to missing checks when Cisco Discovery Protocol messages are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected IP camera to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent)."], "published": "2021-01-13T22:15:14.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
