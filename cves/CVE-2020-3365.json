The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the logic that governs directory permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using capabilities that are not controlled by the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on an affected device."], "published": "2020-09-04T03:15:09.917", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
