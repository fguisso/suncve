In before version 2.0.0, email address validation is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack where some input (for example `a@0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.`) will freeze the program or web browser page executing the code. This affects any current schema-inspector users using any version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do email validation, and instead do other types of validation (like string min or max length, etc), are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 2.0.0, which uses a regex expression that isn't vulnerable to ReDoS."], "published": "2021-03-19T21:15:12.417", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["schema-inspector"], "productName": ["schema-inspector"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/schema-inspector/schema-inspector/security/advisories/GHSA-f38p-c2gq-4pmr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/schema-inspector/schema-inspector/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-cleaning", "javascript", "sanitization", "validation"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 186472, "HTML": 412}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77369772?v=4", "stargazers": 504, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
