This deserialization then led to unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where the Kentico instance was hosted."], "published": "2019-03-26T18:29:00.403", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
