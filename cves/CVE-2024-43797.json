A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-09-02T18:15:36.073", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["advplyr"], "productName": ["audiobookshelf"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-gg56-vj58-g5mc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-gg56-vj58-g5mc", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["audiobook-manager", "audiobooks", "audiobookshelf", "podcasts", "self-hosted"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3095688, "Vue": 1470852, "CSS": 37022, "Shell": 6399, "Dockerfile": 1776, "HTML": 315}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67830747?v=4", "stargazers": 8275, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
