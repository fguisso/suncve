In affected versions more methods than expected can be called on reflex instances. Being able to call some of them has security implications. To invoke a reflex a websocket message of the following shape is sent: `\\\"target\\\":\\\"[class_name]#[method_name]\\\",\\\"args\\\":[]`. The server will proceed to instantiate `reflex` using the provided `class_name` as long as it extends `StimulusReflex::Reflex`. It then attempts to call `method_name` on the instance with the provided arguments. This is problematic as `reflex.method method_name` can be more methods that those explicitly specified by the developer in their reflex class. A good example is the instance_variable_set method. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 3.4.2 and 3.5.0.rc4. Users unable to upgrade should: see the backing GHSA advisory for mitigation advice."], "published": "2024-03-12T20:15:08.313", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stimulusreflex"], "productName": ["stimulus_reflex"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/security/advisories/GHSA-f78j-4w3g-4q65"], "commits": ["https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/commit/538582d240439aab76066c72335ea92096cd0c7f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["actioncable", "cableready", "hacktoberfest", "hotwire", "rails", "reactive", "ruby", "ruby-on-rails", "server-side-rendering", "stimulus", "stimulusreflex", "turbo", "turbolinks", "websocket"], "langs": {"Ruby": 224741, "JavaScript": 151769, "Shell": 313, "HTML": 87}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73479186?v=4", "stargazers": 2302, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
