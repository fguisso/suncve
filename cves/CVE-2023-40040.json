A remote attacker can start the camera feed via the com.cordovaplugincamerapreview.CameraActivity component in some situations. NOTE: this is only exploitable on Android versions that lack runtime permission checks, and of those only Android SDK 5.1.1 API 22 is consistent with the manifest. Thus, this applies only to Android Lollipop, affecting less than five percent of Android devices as of 2023."], "published": "2023-09-11T06:15:43.830", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
