Prior to versions 1.10.9, 1.9.15, and 1.8.22, there are two separate code paths in which memory can be allocated per message in excess of the `grpc.max_receive_message_length` channel option: If an incoming message has a size on the wire greater than the configured limit, the entire message is buffered before it is discarded; and/or if an incoming message has a size within the limit on the wire but decompresses to a size greater than the limit, the entire message is decompressed into memory, and on the server is not discarded. This has been patched in versions 1.10.9, 1.9.15, and 1.8.22.\n"], "published": "2024-06-10T22:15:12.433", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["grpc"], "productName": ["grpc-node"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/security/advisories/GHSA-7v5v-9h63-cj86"], "commits": ["https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/commit/08b0422dae56467ecae1007e899efe66a8c4a650", "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/commit/674f4e351a619fd4532f84ae6dff96b8ee4e1ed3", "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/commit/a8a020339c7eab1347a343a512ad17a4aea4bfdb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["grpc", "hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1872776, "JavaScript": 254012, "C++": 31007, "Shell": 20701, "Dockerfile": 5348, "CMake": 2907, "Batchfile": 2711, "PowerShell": 2270}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7802525?v=4", "stargazers": 4617, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
