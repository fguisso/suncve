Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application."], "published": "2018-08-22T17:29:00.710", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Symantec Corporation"], "productName": ["Norton Utilities"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
