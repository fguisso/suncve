This issue is based on the fact that the PowerDNS server parses all records present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even legitimate. A specially crafted query containing a large number of records can be used to take advantage of that behaviour."], "published": "2018-09-11T13:29:00.713", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Open-Xchange"], "productName": ["pdns"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
