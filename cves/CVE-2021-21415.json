This is a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability that affects all versions of the Prisma VS Code extension older than 2.20.0. If a custom binary path for the Prisma format binary is set in VS Code Settings, for example by downloading a project that has a .vscode/settings.json file that sets a value for \"prismaFmtBinPath\". That custom binary is executed when auto-formatting is triggered by VS Code or when validation checks are triggered after each keypress on a *.prisma file. Fixed in versions 2.20.0 and 20.0.27. As a workaround users can either edit or delete the `.vscode/settings.json` file or check if the binary is malicious and delete it."], "published": "2021-04-29T17:15:08.977", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["prisma"], "productName": ["language-tools"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/security/advisories/GHSA-4rf9-43m7-x828"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["langauge-server", "language-server-protocol", "prisma", "syntax-highlighting", "vscode", "vscode-extension"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 365266, "JavaScript": 27099, "Shell": 5633, "Nix": 4836}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17219288?v=4", "stargazers": 268, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
