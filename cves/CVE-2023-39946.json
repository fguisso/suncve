Prior to versions 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, and 2.6.6, heap can be overflowed by providing a PID_PROPERTY_LIST parameter that contains a CDR string with length larger than the size of actual content. In `eprosima::fastdds::dds::ParameterPropertyList_t::push_back_helper`, `memcpy` is called to first copy the octet'ized length and then to copy the data into `properties_.data`. At the second memcpy, both `data` and `size` can be controlled by anyone that sends the CDR string to the discovery multicast port. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. Versions 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, and 2.6.6 contain a patch for this issue."], "published": "2023-08-11T14:15:13.483", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["eProsima"], "productName": ["Fast-DDS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-j297-rg6j-m7hx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/commit/349227005827e8a67a0406b823138b5068cc47dc"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-j297-rg6j-m7hx", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cpp", "dds", "fastdds", "middleware", "omg", "robotics", "ros2", "rtps"], "langs": {"C++": 47388003, "C": 9849654, "CMake": 590230, "Python": 298645, "CSS": 28054, "Shell": 13986, "Makefile": 5345, "HTML": 2698, "Dockerfile": 1683, "Batchfile": 1395, "PowerShell": 954}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6390783?v=4", "stargazers": 2363, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
