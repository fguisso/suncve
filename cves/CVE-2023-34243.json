In affected versions if a Windows user was registered in tgstation-server (TGS), an attacker could discover their username by brute-forcing the login endpoint with an invalid password. When a valid Windows logon was found, a distinct response would be generated. This issue has been addressed in version 5.12.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may be mitigated by rate-limiting API calls with software that sits in front of TGS in the HTTP pipeline such as fail2ban."], "published": "2023-06-08T22:15:09.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tgstation"], "productName": ["tgstation-server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/security/advisories/GHSA-w3jx-4x93-76ph"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "byond", "client-lib", "database", "discord-bot", "dotnet", "dreammaker", "game-server", "graphql-api", "http", "nuget", "openapi", "rest-api", "ss13", "tgs", "tgstation", "tgstation-server", "uptime-monitor"], "langs": {"C#": 3855685, "DM": 113888, "Shell": 8703, "Nix": 8650, "PowerShell": 5821, "Dockerfile": 2144, "Makefile": 1694, "Roff": 1216, "Batchfile": 734, "HTML": 589}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1363778?v=4", "stargazers": 68, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
