Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`."], "published": "2022-09-07T23:15:14.097", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rust-osdev"], "productName": ["linked-list-allocator"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/013b0758643943e8df5b17bbb495460ff47e8bbf"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 68228}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35896598?v=4", "stargazers": 227, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
