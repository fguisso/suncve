Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`. The vulnerability is fixed in 4.19.2 and 5.0.0-beta.3."], "published": "2024-03-25T21:15:46.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["expressjs"], "productName": ["express"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd", "https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/expressjs/express/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["express", "javascript", "nodejs", "server"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 489643, "Makefile": 330, "Shell": 229}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5658226?v=4", "stargazers": 66683, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
