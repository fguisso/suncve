A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4."], "published": "2024-05-14T15:39:30.633", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nautobot"], "productName": ["nautobot"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/4f0a66bd6307bfe0e0acb899233e0d4ad516f51c", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/f640aedc69c848d3d1be57f0300fc40033ff6423"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dcim", "hacktoberfest", "ipam", "nautobot", "network-automation", "python", "sot"], "langs": {"Python": 8362008, "HTML": 1060828, "JavaScript": 108818, "CSS": 45532, "Jinja": 28376, "Gherkin": 14390, "Dockerfile": 11222, "Shell": 8955}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75628359?v=4", "stargazers": 1167, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
