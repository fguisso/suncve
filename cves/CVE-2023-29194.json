Users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a keyspace containing `/` characters such that from that point on, anyone who tries to view keyspaces from VTAdmin will receive an error. Trying to list all the keyspaces using `vtctldclient GetKeyspaces` will also return an error. Note that all other keyspaces can still be administered using the CLI (vtctldclient). This issue is fixed in version 16.0.1. As a workaround, delete the offending keyspace using a CLI client (vtctldclient)."], "published": "2023-04-14T19:15:09.273", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vitessio"], "productName": ["vitess"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/security/advisories/GHSA-735r-hv67-g38f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commit/adf10196760ad0b3991a7aa7a8580a544e6ddf88"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "database-cluster", "kubernetes", "mysql", "shard", "vitess"], "langs": {"Go": 36636951, "Java": 945768, "TypeScript": 762878, "Yacc": 200725, "Shell": 144547, "Smarty": 42259, "SCSS": 42141, "Assembly": 29554, "Dockerfile": 23233, "Makefile": 16745, "CSS": 10774, "JavaScript": 4145, "Perl": 3161, "Python": 1955, "HCL": 959, "HTML": 807}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33043890?v=4", "stargazers": 19376, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
