Prior to versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, manipulated DATA Submessage can cause a heap overflow error in the Fast-DDS process, causing the process to be terminated remotely. Additionally, the payload_size in the DATA Submessage packet is declared as uint32_t. When a negative number, such as -1, is input into this variable, it results in an Integer Overflow (for example, -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF). This eventually leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, causing the program to terminate. Versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a fix for this issue."], "published": "2024-03-20T20:15:08.893", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["eProsima"], "productName": ["Fast-DDS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-9m2j-qw67-ph4w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/commit/355706386f4af9ce74125eeec3c449b06113112b"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-9m2j-qw67-ph4w", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cpp", "dds", "fastdds", "middleware", "omg", "robotics", "ros2", "rtps"], "langs": {"C++": 47388003, "C": 9849654, "CMake": 590230, "Python": 298645, "CSS": 28054, "Shell": 13986, "Makefile": 5345, "HTML": 2698, "Dockerfile": 1683, "Batchfile": 1395, "PowerShell": 954}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6390783?v=4", "stargazers": 2363, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
