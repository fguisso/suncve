A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files with backslash characters in the file name may cause just-checked out code to be executed while checking out a repository using Git on Cygwin. The problem will be patched in the Cygwin Git v2.31.1-2 release. At time of writing, the vulnerability is present in the upstream Git source code; any Cygwin user who compiles Git for themselves from upstream sources should manually apply a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. As mitigation users should not clone or pull from repositories from untrusted sources. CVE-2019-1354 was an equivalent vulnerability in Git for Visual Studio."], "published": "2021-04-29T21:15:08.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["me-and"], "productName": ["Cygwin-Git"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/me-and/Cygwin-Git/security/advisories/GHSA-rmp3-wq55-f557"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/me-and/Cygwin-Git/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cygwin", "git"], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122601860?v=4", "stargazers": 2, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
