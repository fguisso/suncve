The low-power IPv6 network stack of Contiki-NG has a buffer module (os/net/ipv6/uipbuf.c) that processes IPv6 extension headers in incoming data packets. As part of this processing, the function uipbuf_get_next_header casts a pointer to a uip_ext_hdr structure into the packet buffer at different offsets where extension headers are expected to be found, and then reads from this structure. Because of a lack of bounds checking, the casting can be done so that the structure extends beyond the packet's end. Hence, with a carefully crafted packet, it is possible to cause the Contiki-NG system to read data outside the packet buffer. A patch that fixes the vulnerability is included in Contiki-NG 4.8."], "published": "2022-09-01T12:15:10.313", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["contiki-ng"], "productName": ["contiki-ng"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-2j9c-7754-w4cw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["6lowpan", "6lowpan-border-router", "6tisch", "contiki-ng", "iot", "rpl", "tsch", "wsn"], "langs": {"C": 13758081, "GSC": 688626, "Python": 243324, "CSS": 53122, "Shell": 53016, "Makefile": 49706, "Linker Script": 36491, "Java": 33209, "Perl": 22060, "JavaScript": 14233, "Dockerfile": 7314, "XSLT": 4947}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067801?v=4", "stargazers": 1385, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
