An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device."], "published": "2023-08-16T22:15:10.750", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Prime Infrastructure", "Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
