Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled is affected. A lack of input validation allows authenticated clients to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication is required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests via kernel or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity. Users may upgrade to version 3.2.1 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, install the patch manually."], "published": "2022-01-25T14:15:08.907", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jupyterhub"], "productName": ["jupyter-server-proxy"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-gcv9-6737-pjqw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/commit/fd31930bacd12188c448c886e0783529436b99eb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["binder", "jupyter", "jupyter-notebook", "jupyterhub", "proxy"], "langs": {"Python": 109108, "TypeScript": 12359, "RobotFramework": 4992, "JavaScript": 1609, "HTML": 109}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17927519?v=4", "stargazers": 364, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
