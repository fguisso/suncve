The calculation involves\ndivision and modulus operations, which will cause a crash if either of\nthese values is 0.  While this never happens with a genuine device, it\ncould happen with a flawed or subversive emulation, as reported by the\nsyzbot fuzzer.\n\nProtect against this possibility by refusing to bind to the device if\neither the ATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's ID\ninformation is 0.  This requires isd200_Initialization() to return a\nnegative error code when initialization fails; currently it always\nreturns 0 (even when there is an error)."], "published": "2024-05-01T13:15:50.493", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
