The vulnerability is due to errors that could occur when the affected software constructs and applies per-user-override rules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a network through an affected device that has a vulnerable configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access resources that are behind the affected device and would typically be protected by the interface ACL."], "published": "2018-10-05T14:29:08.230", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
