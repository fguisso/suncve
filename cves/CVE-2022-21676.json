A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io` package starting from version `4.0.0`, including those who uses depending packages like `socket.io`. Versions prior to `4.0.0` are not impacted. A fix has been released for each major branch, namely `4.1.2` for the `4.x.x` branch, `5.2.1` for the `5.x.x` branch, and `6.1.1` for the `6.x.x` branch. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version."], "published": "2022-01-12T19:15:09.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["socketio"], "productName": ["engine.io"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-273r-mgr4-v34f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/66f889fc1d966bf5bfa0de1939069153643874ab", "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/a70800d7e96da32f6e6622804ef659ebc58659db", "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/c0e194d44933bd83bf9a4b126fca68ba7bf5098c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "nodejs", "real-time", "websocket"], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10566080?v=4", "stargazers": 4593, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
