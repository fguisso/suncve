Prior to versions 6.2.7 and 7.0.0, an attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the redis-server process. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules."], "published": "2022-04-27T20:15:09.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["redis"], "productName": ["redis"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-3qpw-7686-5984"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/redis/redis/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cache", "database", "key-value", "message-broker", "nosql", "redis"], "langs": {"C": 7375634, "Tcl": 2458884, "Python": 149631, "Makefile": 28225, "Shell": 23638, "Ruby": 23260, "C++": 5987, "Smarty": 1047, "JavaScript": 953}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529926?v=4", "stargazers": 68587, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
