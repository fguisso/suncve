In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds"], "published": "2023-01-04T15:15:09.510", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mattkrick"], "productName": ["sanitize-svg"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/security/advisories/GHSA-h857-2g56-468g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/commit/b107e453ede7b58adcccae74a3e474c012eec85d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1809}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5514175?v=4", "stargazers": 27, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
