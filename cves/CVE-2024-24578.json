RaspberryMatic / OCCU prior to version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based `HMIPServer.jar` component. RaspberryMatric includes a Java based `HMIPServer`, that can be accessed through URLs starting with `/pages/jpages`. The `FirmwareController` class does however not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session. Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise. Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch."], "published": "2024-03-18T22:15:07.683", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jens-maus"], "productName": ["RaspberryMatic"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/security/advisories/GHSA-q967-q4j8-637h"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/security/advisories/GHSA-q967-q4j8-637h", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["buildroot", "ccu", "ccu3", "docker", "elv-charly", "embedded-devices", "esxi", "home-automation", "homeassistant", "homematic", "homematicip", "iot", "kubernetes", "linux", "operating-system", "raspberrymatic", "raspberrypi", "smarthome", "tinkerboard", "virtual-appliance"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 133086922, "Tcl": 9609012, "HTML": 4555277, "CSS": 3206989, "Shell": 414039, "C++": 331903, "Python": 264603, "Makefile": 222658, "FreeMarker": 128088, "C": 60087, "Meson": 23794, "Batchfile": 22101, "Dockerfile": 3052, "SCSS": 2054}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5887769?v=4", "stargazers": 1630, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
