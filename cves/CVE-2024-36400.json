Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified. It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability. This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0."], "published": "2024-06-04T15:15:46.980", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["viz-rs"], "productName": ["nano-id"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/security/advisories/GHSA-9hc7-6w9r-wj94"], "commits": ["https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/commit/a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/security/advisories/GHSA-9hc7-6w9r-wj94", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 2894}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41245784?v=4", "stargazers": 12, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
