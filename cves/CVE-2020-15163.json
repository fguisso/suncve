This allows an attacker who is able to serve multiple new versions of root metadata (i.e. by a person-in-the-middle attack) culminating in a version which has not been correctly signed to control the trust chain for future updates. This is fixed in version 0.12 and newer."], "published": "2020-09-09T18:15:22.480", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["theupdateframework"], "productName": ["tuf"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-f8mr-jv2c-v8mg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/commit/3d342e648fbacdf43a13d7ba8886aaaf07334af7"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "compromise", "key", "python", "repository", "revocation", "security", "software", "update"], "langs": {"Python": 457704}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4633028?v=4", "stargazers": 1652, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
