The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service accountâ€™s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation are used together with containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated."], "published": "2024-04-22T23:15:51.180", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Kubernetes"], "productName": ["Kubernetes"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Cgv-Dev/Metasploit-Module-TFM", "https://github.com/Cgv-Dev/Metasploit-Module-TFM"]}
