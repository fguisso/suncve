NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation."], "published": "2021-04-28T03:15:07.400", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/e2e07a355ee8ff36aba21d0242c5950c56e4c6f9"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["attachment", "email", "hacktoberfest", "php", "php-library", "phpmailer", "smtp", "tls-support", "xoauth2"], "langs": {"PHP": 687351, "Shell": 3851}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3959702?v=4", "stargazers": 21368, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
