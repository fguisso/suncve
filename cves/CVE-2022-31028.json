Starting with version RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z and ending with version RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z, MinIO is vulnerable to an unending go-routine buildup while keeping connections established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections. Public-facing MinIO deployments are most affected. Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z to receive a patch. One possible workaround is to use a reverse proxy to limit the number of connections being attempted in front of MinIO, and actively rejecting connections from such malicious clients."], "published": "2022-06-07T16:15:07.760", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["minio"], "productName": ["minio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-qrpr-r3pw-f636"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/minio/minio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["amazon-s3", "cloud", "cloudnative", "cloudstorage", "go", "k8s", "kubernetes", "multi-cloud", "multi-cloud-kubernetes", "objectstorage", "s3", "storage"], "langs": {"Go": 8721848, "Shell": 72041, "Makefile": 11677, "Mustache": 6628, "Smarty": 872, "Dockerfile": 229}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/695951?v=4", "stargazers": 51341, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
