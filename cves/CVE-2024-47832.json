Affected versions are vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An attacker can carry out signature bypass if you have access to certain IDP-signed messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential behavior between XML parsers. Users of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of SSOReady, are unaffected. We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or later. Do so by updating your SSOReady Docker images from sha-... to sha-7f92a06. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-10-09T19:15:14.647", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ssoready"], "productName": ["ssoready"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/security/advisories/GHSA-j2hr-q93x-gxvh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/commit/7f92a0630439972fcbefa8c7eafe8c144bd89915"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["auth", "authentication", "authentication-middleware", "directory-sync", "saml", "saml-authentication", "saml-service-provider", "saml-sp-single-sign-on", "saml2", "scim", "single-sign-on", "single-signin-api", "sso", "sso-api", "sso-authentication", "sso-login", "sso-solution"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1164931, "Go": 418331, "CSS": 17778, "JavaScript": 9735, "HTML": 8050, "Dockerfile": 2542, "Shell": 2335, "Makefile": 213}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150834783?v=4", "stargazers": 1437, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
