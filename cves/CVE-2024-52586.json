A vulnerability has been found starting in version 4.6.0 and prior to version 5.1.0 that allows an attacker to bypass eLabFTW's built-in multifactor authentication mechanism. An attacker who can authenticate locally (by knowing or guessing the password of a user) can thus log in regardless of MFA requirements. This does not affect MFA that are performed by single sign-on services. Users are advised to upgrade to at least version 5.1.9 to receive a fix."], "published": "2024-12-09T19:15:13.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["elabftw"], "productName": ["elabftw"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/security/advisories/GHSA-pvxr-39g3-m28c"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["docker", "laboratory", "lims", "mysql", "notebook", "php"], "langs": {"PHP": 1710012, "HTML": 557745, "TypeScript": 457372, "JavaScript": 342016, "SCSS": 42696, "Shell": 9838, "PEG.js": 4636, "Dockerfile": 2718, "TeX": 667, "Twig": 250, "CSS": 152}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7669213?v=4", "stargazers": 1085, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
