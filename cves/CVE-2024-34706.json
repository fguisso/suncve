When opening a form in Valtimo, the access token (JWT) of the user is exposed to `api.form.io` via the the `x-jwt-token` header. An attacker can retrieve personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo REST API on behalf of the logged-in user. This issue is caused by a misconfiguration of the Form.io component.\n\nThe following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: An attacker needs to have access to the network traffic on the `api.form.io` domain; the content of the `x-jwt-token` header is logged or otherwise available to the attacker; an attacker needs to have network access to the Valtimo API; and an attacker needs to act within the time-to-live of the access token. The default TTL in Keycloak is 5 minutes.\n\nVersions 10.8.4, 11.1.6 and 11.2.2 have been patched."], "published": "2024-05-14T15:39:29.990", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["valtimo-platform"], "productName": ["valtimo-frontend-libraries"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-xcp4-62vj-cq3r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/1aaba5ef5750dafebbc7476fb08bf2375a25f19e", "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/8c2dbf2a41180d2b0358d878290e4d37168f0fb6", "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/d65e05fd2784bd4a628778b34a5b79ce2f0cef8c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 3379430, "JavaScript": 1250543, "HTML": 955616, "CSS": 663010, "SCSS": 495909, "Dockerfile": 379}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69813354?v=4", "stargazers": 6, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
