Node-RED 1.2.7 and earlier has a vulnerability which allows arbitrary path traversal via the Projects API. If the Projects feature is enabled, a user with `projects.read` permission is able to access any file via the Projects API. The issue has been patched in Node-RED 1.2.8. The vulnerability applies only to the Projects feature which is not enabled by default in Node-RED. The primary workaround is not give untrusted users read access to the Node-RED editor."], "published": "2021-02-26T17:15:12.337", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["node-red"], "productName": ["node-red"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/node-red/node-red/security/advisories/GHSA-m33v-338h-4v9f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/node-red/node-red/commit/74db3e17d075f23d9c95d7871586cf461524c456"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/node-red/node-red/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["flow-based-programming", "javascript", "low-code", "node-red", "openjs-foundation", "visual-programming"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 2534686, "HTML": 5974, "Shell": 265, "CSS": 44}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5375661?v=4", "stargazers": 20784, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
