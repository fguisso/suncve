An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to read sensitive information about the target system.</p>\n<p>To exploit this condition, an authenticated attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the AD|DNS service. Note that the information disclosure vulnerability by itself would not be sufficient for an attacker to compromise a system. However, an attacker could combine this vulnerability with additional vulnerabilities to further exploit the system.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) handles objects in memory.</p>\n"], "published": "2020-09-11T17:15:13.137", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows Server version 2004", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2008  Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012", "Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012 R2", "Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
