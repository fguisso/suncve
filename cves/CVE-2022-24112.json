A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote code execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed."], "published": "2022-02-11T13:15:08.073", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache APISIX"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Mr-xn/CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/CrackerCat/CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/Axx8/CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/Mah1ndra/CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/M4xSec/Apache-APISIX-CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/kavishkagihan/CVE-2022-24112-POC", "https://github.com/twseptian/cve-2022-24112", "https://github.com/Acczdy/CVE-2022-24112_POC", "https://github.com/btar1gan/exploit_CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/Mr-xn/CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/CrackerCat/CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/Axx8/CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/Mah1ndra/CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/M4xSec/Apache-APISIX-CVE-2022-24112", "https://github.com/kavishkagihan/CVE-2022-24112-POC", "https://github.com/twseptian/cve-2022-24112", "https://github.com/Acczdy/CVE-2022-24112_POC", "https://github.com/btar1gan/exploit_CVE-2022-24112"]}
