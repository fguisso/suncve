It is not possible to inject javascript code in the file name when creating/uploading the file. But, once created/uploaded, it can be renamed to inject the payload in it. Additionally, the measures to prevent renaming the file to disallowed filename extensions could be circumvented. This is fixed in Bolt 3.7.1."], "published": "2020-06-08T22:15:10.697", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["bolt"], "productName": ["bolt"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/bolt/bolt/security/advisories/GHSA-68q3-7wjp-7q3j"], "commits": ["https://github.com/bolt/bolt/commit/b42cbfcf3e3108c46a80581216ba03ef449e419f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/bolt/bolt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bolt", "cmf", "cms", "mysql", "php", "postgresql", "silex", "sqlite", "symfony", "symfony-application", "theme", "twig"], "langs": {"PHP": 3268063, "JavaScript": 596141, "Twig": 397445, "CSS": 161157, "SCSS": 92948, "HTML": 18349, "Shell": 2618}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3869752?v=4", "stargazers": 4155, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
