An attacker with adjacent short-range access to an affected product, in situations where the productâ€™s radio is turned on, can inject, replay, modify, and/or intercept data within the telemetry communication. This communication protocol provides the ability to read and write memory values to affected implanted cardiac devices; therefore, an attacker could exploit this communication protocol to change memory in the implanted cardiac device."], "published": "2019-03-25T22:29:00.763", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Medtronic"], "productName": ["Medtronic Conexus Radio Frequency Telemetry Protocol"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
