This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. User registration must be enabled for this to be exploited."], "published": "2024-11-09T08:15:04.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vanquish"], "productName": ["WordPress User Extra Fields"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
