The affected system allows to upload JSON objects that are deserialized to Java objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, a privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java object. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges."], "published": "2022-03-08T12:15:11.493", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Siemens"], "productName": ["SINEC NMS", "SINEMA Server V14"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
