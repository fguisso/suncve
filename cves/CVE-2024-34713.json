Prior to version 1.6.3, any user authorized to connect to a ssh server using `sshproxy` can inject options to the `ssh` command executed by `sshproxy`. All versions of `sshproxy` are impacted. The problem is patched starting in version 1.6.3. The only workaround is to use the `force_command` option in `sshproxy.yaml`, but it's rarely relevant."], "published": "2024-05-14T16:17:27.147", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["cea-hpc"], "productName": ["sshproxy"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/cea-hpc/sshproxy/security/advisories/GHSA-jmqp-37m5-49wh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/cea-hpc/sshproxy/commit/f7eabd05d5f0f951e160293692327cad9a7d9580"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/cea-hpc/sshproxy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cea", "etcd", "go", "ssh"], "langs": {"Go": 156611, "Shell": 7944, "Makefile": 3548, "Dockerfile": 2055}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1496664?v=4", "stargazers": 104, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
