Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-10-06T18:16:09.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dexidp"], "productName": ["dex"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/GHSA-vh7g-p26c-j2cw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dexidp/dex/commit/49471b14c8080ddb034d4855841123d378b7a634"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/GHSA-vh7g-p26c-j2cw", "kw": ["steps to reproduce", "steps:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/dexidp/dex/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "identity-provider", "idp", "kubernetes", "oidc"], "langs": {"Go": 1125086, "Makefile": 7323, "CSS": 6590, "HTML": 5662, "Dockerfile": 2971, "Shell": 1704, "Nix": 1198}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42422344?v=4", "stargazers": 9796, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
