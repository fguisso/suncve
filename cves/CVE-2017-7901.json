Insufficiently random TCP initial sequence numbers are generated, which may allow an attacker to predict the numbers from previous values. This may allow an attacker to spoof or disrupt TCP connections, resulting in a denial of service for the target device."], "published": "2017-06-30T03:29:00.797", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1100 and 1400"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
