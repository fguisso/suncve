In versions of Kyverno prior to 1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field defined can bypass validate, generate, or mutate-existing policies, even in cases where the `validationFailureAction` field is set to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources pending deletion were being consciously exempted by Kyverno, as a way to reduce processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects which are being deleted. However, this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user to leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes API server to set the `deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the delete operation as a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this is not applicable to Kubernetes Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes Service resource can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass policies. This is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known workaround."], "published": "2023-06-01T17:15:10.873", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kyverno"], "productName": ["kyverno"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-hq4m-4948-64cc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["kubernetes", "policy-management"], "langs": {"Go": 7610930, "Makefile": 55120, "Shell": 27877, "Mustache": 25031, "Dockerfile": 1720}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68448710?v=4", "stargazers": 6194, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
