This results in a mismatch because paths in URLs are case-sensitive, but the regex matching treats them as case-insensitive. This misconfiguration can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized origins to access paths meant to be restricted, resulting in data exposure and potential data leaks."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:34.620", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["corydolphin"], "productName": ["corydolphin/flask-cors"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
