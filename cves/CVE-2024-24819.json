In affected versions the class `gipfl\\Web\\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form, unless explicitly disabled, but even if enabled, the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which, unknowingly, interacts with a prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-02-09T01:15:10.080", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Icinga"], "productName": ["icingaweb2-module-incubator"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator/security/advisories/GHSA-p8vv-9pqq-rm8p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator/commit/db7dc49585fee0b4e96be666d7f6009a74a1ccb5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 2024, "Shell": 1682, "PHP": 1011, "Less": 80}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/835441?v=4", "stargazers": 24, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
