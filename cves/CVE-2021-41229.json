In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash."], "published": "2021-11-12T23:15:08.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["bluez"], "productName": ["bluez"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/bluez/bluez/security/advisories/GHSA-3fqg-r8j5-f5xq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/bluez/bluez/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bluetooth", "bluetooth-le-audio", "bluetooth-low-energy", "bluetooth-mesh", "linux"], "langs": {"C": 14156483, "Python": 225544, "Makefile": 52878, "Roff": 27429, "M4": 23917, "Shell": 2772, "Perl": 1645}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57395048?v=4", "stargazers": 835, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
