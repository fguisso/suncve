The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction."], "published": "2021-07-02T19:15:08.063", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stellar"], "productName": ["js-stellar-sdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6cgh-hjpw-q3gq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blockchain", "cryptocurrency", "horizon", "javascript", "sdk", "stellar"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 503213, "TypeScript": 406114, "Shell": 3885}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7386716?v=4", "stargazers": 657, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
