The django_ses library implements a mail backend for Django using AWS Simple Email Service. The library exports the `SESEventWebhookView class` intended to receive signed requests from AWS to handle email bounces, subscriptions, etc. These requests are signed by AWS and are verified by django_ses, however the verification of this signature was found to be flawed as it allowed users to specify arbitrary public certificates. This issue was patched in version 3.5.0."], "published": "2023-05-26T21:15:20.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["django-ses"], "productName": ["django-ses"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/security/advisories/GHSA-qg36-9jxh-fj25"], "commits": ["https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/commit/b71b5f413293a13997b6e6314086cb9c22629795"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 161697, "HTML": 6165}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12100228?v=4", "stargazers": 1043, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
