A low privileged process can crash CmdVirth.exe to decrease the port's connection count followed by process hollowing a CmdVirth.exe instance with malicious code to obtain a handle to \"cmdServicePort\". Once this occurs, a specially crafted message can be sent to \"cmdServicePort\" using \"FilterSendMessage\" API. This can trigger an out-of-bounds write if lpOutBuffer parameter in FilterSendMessage API is near the end of specified buffer bounds. The crash occurs when the driver performs a memset operation which uses a size beyond the size of buffer specified, causing kernel crash."], "published": "2019-07-17T21:15:12.780", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Comodo Antivirus"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
