A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem. However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization, which can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`."], "published": "2022-01-13T21:15:08.690", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flatpak"], "productName": ["flatpak"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-8ch7-5j3h-g4fx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/445bddeee657fdc8d2a0a1f0de12975400d4fc1a", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/4d11f77aa7fd3e64cfa80af89d92567ab9e8e6fa"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 4873996, "Shell": 253943, "Python": 95324, "Meson": 63126, "Yacc": 46057, "Makefile": 1402, "M4": 1366}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19473042?v=4", "stargazers": 4416, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
