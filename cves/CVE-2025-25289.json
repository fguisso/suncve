Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 6.1.7, a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the processing of HTTP request headers. By sending an authorization header containing an excessively long sequence of spaces followed by a newline and \"@\", an attacker can exploit inefficient regular expression processing, leading to excessive resource consumption. This can significantly degrade server performance or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, impacting availability. Version 6.1.7 contains a fix for the issue."], "published": "2025-02-14T20:15:35.100", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["octokit"], "productName": ["request-error.js"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/security/advisories/GHSA-xx4v-prfh-6cgc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/commit/d558320874a4bc8d356babf1079e6f0056a59b9e"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/security/advisories/GHSA-xx4v-prfh-6cgc", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "octokit-js", "plugin"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 7219, "JavaScript": 3831}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3430433?v=4", "stargazers": 16, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
