The vulnerability arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the configuration settings, specifically within the 'extensions' parameter. Attackers can exploit this by crafting a payload that includes relative path traversal sequences ('../../../'), enabling them to navigate to arbitrary directories. This flaw subsequently allows the server to load and execute a malicious '__init__.py' file, leading to remote code execution. The issue affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui."], "published": "2024-05-16T09:15:09.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms-webui"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
