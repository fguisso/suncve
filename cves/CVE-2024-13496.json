This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. NOTE: This vulnerability was previously published as being fixed in version 7.2.2 which was incorrect. The correct fixed version is 7.3.2."], "published": "2025-01-22T11:15:08.373", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rubengc"], "productName": ["GamiPress – Gamification plugin to reward points, achievements, badges & ranks in WordPress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
