Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory."], "published": "2022-06-01T23:15:07.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["bigbluebutton"], "productName": ["bigbluebutton"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-rwrv-p665-4vwp"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bigbluebutton", "collaboration", "conferencing", "video", "video-conferencing", "webrtc"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3902931, "Scala": 1671976, "TypeScript": 1667729, "Java": 1179516, "Ruby": 404534, "Shell": 280964, "Groovy": 164446, "CSS": 162616, "Go": 114808, "PLpgSQL": 99643, "Python": 75857, "HTML": 27674, "Batchfile": 2375, "Gherkin": 925, "Dockerfile": 59, "PostScript": 36}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230228?v=4", "stargazers": 8752, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
