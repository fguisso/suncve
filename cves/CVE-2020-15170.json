If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it doesn't have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to access/edit the application's configurations. To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet."], "published": "2020-09-10T19:15:13.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ctripcorp"], "productName": ["apollo"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-xpmx-h7xq-xffh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["config-management", "configuration-management", "distributed-configuration", "microservices", "spring-boot", "spring-cloud"], "langs": {"Java": 2638715, "HTML": 533731, "JavaScript": 435983, "Shell": 45513, "CSS": 23489, "Dockerfile": 6482, "Batchfile": 2286}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83490506?v=4", "stargazers": 29417, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
