Run python3 dodyssey.py 6. You will get a hit on your nc showing we have successfully proceded to send a server side request 7. dodyssey.py will show error since there is no img file on the url, but we are able to do SSRF"], "published": "2021-02-18T16:15:12.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["reportlab"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
