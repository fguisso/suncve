Prior to 1.0.1, if the $_GET['seoOp'] parameter is manipulated to include malicious input (e.g., seoOp=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/config.php), the application could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server (Local File Inclusion, LFI). The $_GET['seoOp'] and $_GET['seoArg'] parameters are directly used without sanitization or validation. This is partly mitigated by the fact that the ImpressCMS sensitive files are stored outside the web root, in a folder with a randomized name. The issue has been resolved in imFaq 1.0.1."], "published": "2025-03-18T19:15:51.340", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ImpressModules"], "productName": ["imfaq"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ImpressModules/imfaq/security/advisories/GHSA-vrr3-54vc-vwg3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ImpressModules/imfaq/commit/63dedd30a8f196db7b340740adf667a39c26a4ac"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ImpressModules/imfaq/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["faq", "impresscms-module"], "langs": {"PHP": 311427, "JavaScript": 50332, "HTML": 11315, "CSS": 9636, "Smarty": 1769}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24572059?v=4", "stargazers": 0, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
