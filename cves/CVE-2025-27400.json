Versions prior to 20.12.3 and 20.13.1 contain a vulnerability that allows script execution in the admin panel which could lead to cross-site scripting against authenticated admin users. The attack requires an admin user with configuration access, so in practicality it is not very likely to be useful given that a user with this level of access is probably already a full admin. Versions 20.12.3 and 20.13.1 contain a patch for the issue."], "published": "2025-02-28T16:15:40.237", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenMage"], "productName": ["magento-lts"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/security/advisories/GHSA-5pxh-89cx-4668"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/commit/d307e5bf75729a2347dde0952fe9fd9fcd9c6aea"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["composer", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-framework", "ecommerce-platform", "hacktoberfest", "magento", "magento-1", "magento1", "openmage", "php"], "langs": {"PHP": 26820374, "HTML": 4099913, "JavaScript": 882594, "CSS": 494354, "SCSS": 346314, "Shell": 17574, "Ruby": 288}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57708?v=4", "stargazers": 888, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
