The attacker can send a PFCP Session Establishment Request with \"internet\" as the PDI Network Instance. The first character is interpreted as a length value to be used in a memcpy call. The destination buffer is only 100 bytes long on the stack. Then, 'i' gets interpreted as 105 bytes to copy from the source buffer to the destination buffer."], "published": "2021-10-07T15:15:11.200", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
