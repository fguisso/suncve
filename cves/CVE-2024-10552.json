This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 3.14.25."], "published": "2025-01-25T07:15:07.380", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flexmls"], "productName": ["Flexmls® IDX Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
