When the Apache Pulsar Proxy component is used, it is possible to attempt to open TCP/IP connections to any IP address and port that the Pulsar Proxy can connect to. An attacker could use this as a way for DoS attacks that originate from the Pulsar Proxy's IP address. It hasnâ€™t been detected that the Pulsar Proxy authentication can be bypassed. The attacker will have to have a valid token to a properly secured Pulsar Proxy. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.2; 2.9.0 to 2.9.1; 2.6.4 and earlier."], "published": "2022-09-23T10:15:10.087", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Pulsar"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
