This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, the plugin only allows administrators access to edit Image Hovers, however, if a site admin makes the plugin's features available to lower privileged users through the 'Who Can Edit?' setting then this can be exploited by those users."], "published": "2022-12-13T21:15:12.073", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["biplob018"], "productName": ["Image Hover Effects Ultimate (Image Gallery, Effects, Lightbox, Comparison or Magnifier)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/MrOxizen/image-hover-effects-ultimate/commit/4ba784e1a2a0cf02e8b8cbe3db7323735d7dedc9"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/MrOxizen/image-hover-effects-ultimate/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 3391828, "CSS": 937308, "JavaScript": 484144}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50793821?v=4", "stargazers": 0, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
