The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP option number field of all options present in the input packet. Each option number is calculated as a sum of the previous option number and a delta of the current option. The delta and the previous option number are expressed as unsigned 16-bit integers. Due to lack of overflow detection, it is possible to craft a packet that wraps the option number around and results in the same option number being processed again in a single packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation function. In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY, COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH, COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY, and COAP_OPTION_ETAG, there is no check on whether memory has already been allocated, which in conjunction with the option number integer overflow may lead to multiple assignments of allocated memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated to lead to memory leak by buffer orphaning. As a result, the memory is never freed."], "published": "2020-06-18T19:15:11.783", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/mjurczak/mbed-coap/commit/4647a68e364401e81dbd370728127d844f221d93"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/mjurczak/mbed-coap/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 313155, "C++": 131858, "Makefile": 21106, "Shell": 3202, "XSLT": 2798}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9540275?v=4", "stargazers": 0, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
