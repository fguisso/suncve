Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access. The ci-failure-comment.yml workflow is triggered when the Monkey CI workflow completes. When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0."], "published": "2024-08-02T15:16:36.503", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["monkeytypegame"], "productName": ["monkeytype"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/security/advisories/GHSA-wcjf-5464-4wq9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/commit/29627fd0d5f152e2da59671987090ea0a5c29874"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/security/advisories/GHSA-wcjf-5464-4wq9", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["monkeytype", "typingtest"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2512975, "HTML": 282289, "SCSS": 216328, "CSS": 111145, "JavaScript": 73952, "Lua": 3424, "Shell": 2885, "Dockerfile": 2176}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104658077?v=4", "stargazers": 17100, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
