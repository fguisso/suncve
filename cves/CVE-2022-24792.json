A denial-of-service vulnerability affects applications on a 32-bit systems that use PJSIP versions 2.12 and prior to play/read invalid WAV files. The vulnerability occurs when reading WAV file data chunks with length greater than 31-bit integers. The vulnerability does not affect 64-bit apps and should not affect apps that only plays trusted WAV files. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/project` GitHub repository. As a workaround, apps can reject a WAV file received from an unknown source or validate the file first."], "published": "2022-04-25T16:16:09.003", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pjsip"], "productName": ["pjproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-rwgw-vwxg-q799"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/947bc1ee6d05be10204b918df75a503415fd3213"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android", "android-ndk", "ios", "nat-traversal", "pjsip", "rtp", "sip", "voip"], "langs": {"C": 15490501, "C++": 1671762, "Python": 553464, "Shell": 399759, "Objective-C": 327121, "C#": 141563, "Java": 115523, "Makefile": 115518, "Mathematica": 86105, "SWIG": 43117, "Swift": 38034, "CSS": 21213, "Kotlin": 18705, "Rust": 4860, "Objective-C++": 3801, "HTML": 3320, "QMake": 3180, "Batchfile": 1805, "QML": 1121, "Pan": 288, "Prolog": 25}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6085234?v=4", "stargazers": 2263, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
