This issue does not require any specific routing protocol to be configured or enabled.\n\nThe following commands can be used to monitor the DDoS protection queue:\n\n       labuser@re0> show evo-pfemand host pkt-stats\n\n    labuser@re0> show host-path ddos all-policers\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S1-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-EVO."], "published": "2024-10-11T16:15:08.533", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS Evolved"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
