Prior to 1.6.2, 1.7.2, and 2.0.2, a discovered vulnerability allows users to modify their shopping cart after completing the PayPal Checkout process and payment authorization. If a user initiates a PayPal transaction from a product page or the cart page and then returns to the order summary page, they can still manipulate the cart contents before finalizing the order. As a result, the order amount in Sylius may be higher than the amount actually captured by PayPal, leading to a scenario where merchants deliver products or services without full payment. The issue is fixed in versions: 1.6.2, 1.7.2, 2.0.2 and above."], "published": "2025-03-19T16:15:33.313", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Sylius"], "productName": ["PayPalPlugin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/security/advisories/GHSA-hxg4-65p5-9w37"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/commit/5613df827a6d4fc50862229295976200a68e97aa"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ecommerce", "hacktoberfest", "payment", "payment-gateway", "paypal", "sylius"], "langs": {"PHP": 480186, "Twig": 38152, "Gherkin": 5265, "JavaScript": 2100}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/719423?v=4", "stargazers": 42, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
