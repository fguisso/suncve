The issue arises when a large number of tracked metrics are retrieved simultaneously from the Aim web API, causing the web server to become unresponsive. The root cause is the lack of a limit on the number of metrics that can be requested per call, combined with the server's single-threaded nature, leading to excessive resource consumption and blocking of the server."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:30.480", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aimhubio"], "productName": ["aimhubio/aim"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
