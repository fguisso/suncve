For example, something like:\n\n\n\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule \"^/here/(.*)\" \"http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1\"; [P]\nProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/\n\n\nRequest splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning. Users are recommended to update to at least version 2.4.56 of Apache HTTP Server.\n\n\n"], "published": "2023-03-07T16:15:09.477", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache HTTP Server"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/tbachvarova/linux-apache-fix-mod_rewrite-spaceInURL", "https://github.com/dhmosfunk/CVE-2023-25690-POC", "https://github.com/thanhlam-attt/CVE-2023-25690", "https://github.com/tbachvarova/linux-apache-fix-mod_rewrite-spaceInURL", "https://github.com/dhmosfunk/CVE-2023-25690-POC", "https://github.com/thanhlam-attt/CVE-2023-25690"]}
