The vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters in a Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet to the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) data port of an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an infinite loop, resulting in a process crash that would cause a reload of the device."], "published": "2020-06-03T18:15:20.103", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XE Software 16.10.1"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
