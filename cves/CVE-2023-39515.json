Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the cacti's database. These data will be viewed by administrative cacti accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `data_debug.php` displays data source related debugging information such as _data source paths, polling settings, meta-data on the data source_. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious data-source path, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user that has privileges related to viewing the `data_debug.php` information. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the data source path in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output."], "published": "2023-09-05T21:15:47.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cacti"], "productName": ["cacti"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-hrg9-qqqx-wc4h"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-hrg9-qqqx-wc4h", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cacti", "cacti-community", "cacti-framework", "data-gathering", "graph", "graph-templating", "network-discovery", "php", "rrd-files", "rrdtool"], "langs": {"PHP": 7014030, "JavaScript": 2536428, "CSS": 1220532, "SCSS": 255696, "Less": 246030, "Shell": 51723, "Perl": 7357, "HTML": 5179, "Ruby": 2138}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142645?v=4", "stargazers": 1710, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
