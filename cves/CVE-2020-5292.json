The impact is high. Malicious users/attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries negatively affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the site. Attackers can exfiltrate data like the users' and administrators' password hashes, modify data, or drop tables. The unescaped parameter is \"searchUsers\" when sending a POST request to \"/tickets/showKanban\" with a valid session. In the code, the parameter is named \"users\" in class.tickets.php.
