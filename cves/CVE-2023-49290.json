A p2c parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm PBES2-* could lead to a denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function, making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource- intensive. Therefore, if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause a lot of computational consumption, resulting in a denial of service. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has been included in release version 1.2.27 and 2.0.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-12-05T00:15:09.190", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["lestrrat-go"], "productName": ["jwx"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/64f2a229b8e18605f47361d292b526bdc4aee01c"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["go", "golang", "jwe", "jwk", "jws", "jwt", "oidc"], "langs": {"Go": 1001540, "Starlark": 24657, "Shell": 7002, "Perl": 2801, "Makefile": 2366}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36653903?v=4", "stargazers": 2045, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
