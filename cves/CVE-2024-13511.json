The issue exists in the settings_init() function, which processes a reset action based on specific query parameters in the URL. The related delete_settings() function performs a faulty nonce validation check, making the reset operation insecure and susceptible to unauthorized access."], "published": "2025-01-23T10:15:07.253", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["themehunk"], "productName": ["Variation Swatches for WooCommerce"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
