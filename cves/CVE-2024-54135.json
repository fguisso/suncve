ClipBucket-v5 Version 2.0 to Version 5.5.1 Revision 199 are vulnerable to PHP Deserialization vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in upload/photo_upload.php  within the decode_key function. User inputs were supplied to this function without sanitization via collection GET parameter and photoIDS POST parameter respectively. The decode_key function invokes PHP unserialize function as defined in upload/includes/classes/photos.class.php. As a result, it is possible for an adversary to inject maliciously crafted PHP serialized object and utilize gadget chains to cause unexpected behaviors of the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 Revision 200."], "published": "2024-12-06T16:15:22.340", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MacWarrior"], "productName": ["clipbucket-v5"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-4523-mqmv-wrqx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/76a829c088f0813ab3244a3bd0036111017409b0"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-4523-mqmv-wrqx", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 7664971, "PHP": 3550064, "HTML": 1182994, "CSS": 344123, "Shell": 27670, "Batchfile": 18078, "Hack": 1729, "Roff": 2}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200590?v=4", "stargazers": 112, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
