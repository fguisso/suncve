A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.2 and 2.24.1 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in the GeoServer catalog that will execute in the context of another administratorâ€™s browser when viewed in the GWC Seed Form. Access to the GWC Seed Form is limited to full administrators by default and granting non-administrators access to this endpoint is not recommended. Versions 2.23.2 and 2.24.1 contain a fix for this issue."], "published": "2024-03-20T18:15:09.047", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["geoserver"], "productName": ["geoserver"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-56r3-f536-5gf7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/GeoWebCache/geowebcache/commit/9d010e09c784690ada8af43f594461a2553a62f0"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-56r3-f536-5gf7", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/GeoWebCache/geowebcache/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 3959947, "JavaScript": 24942, "XSLT": 19096, "CSS": 5892, "Shell": 3337, "HTML": 3147, "Scheme": 1448}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/422721?v=4", "stargazers": 348, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
