Manual intervention may be required before a device resumes normal operations. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to cease forwarding traffic, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability."], "published": "2019-05-15T22:29:00.247", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
