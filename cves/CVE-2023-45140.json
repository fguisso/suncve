SCP and SFTP plugins don't honor group-based JIT MFA. Establishing a SCP/SFTP connection through The Bastion via a group access where MFA is enforced does not ask for additional factor. This abnormal behavior only applies to per-group-based JIT MFA. Other MFA setup types, such as Immediate MFA, JIT MFA on a per-plugin basis and JIT MFA on a per-account basis are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 3.14.15."], "published": "2023-11-08T16:15:09.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ovh"], "productName": ["the-bastion"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/security/advisories/GHSA-pr4q-w883-pf5x"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bastion", "security", "ssh"], "langs": {"Perl": 1162792, "Shell": 489771, "Dockerfile": 591}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1698434?v=4", "stargazers": 1596, "language": "Perl"}}, "pocList": []}
