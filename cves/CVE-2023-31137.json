In version 3.5.0024 and prior, a remotely exploitable integer underflow vulnerability in the DNS packet decompression function allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an abnormal program termination.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the `decomp_get_rddata` function within the `Decompress.c` file. When handling a DNS packet with an Answer RR of qtype 16 (TXT record) and any qclass, if the `rdlength` is smaller than `rdata`, the result of the line `Decompress.c:886` is a negative number `len = rdlength - total;`. This value is then passed to the `decomp_append_bytes` function without proper validation, causing the program to attempt to allocate a massive chunk of memory that is impossible to allocate. Consequently, the program exits with an error code of 64, causing a Denial of Service.\n\nOne proposed fix for this vulnerability is to patch `Decompress.c:887` by breaking `if(len <= 0)`, which has been incorporated in version 3.5.0036 via commit bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58."], "published": "2023-05-09T14:15:13.607", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["samboy"], "productName": ["MaraDNS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/security/advisories/GHSA-58m7-826v-9c3c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/commit/bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/security/advisories/GHSA-58m7-826v-9c3c", "kw": ["poc", "payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dns", "dns-servers", "recursive-dns"], "langs": {"C": 2610427, "Shell": 996874, "HTML": 352266, "Roff": 74496, "Makefile": 22710, "DIGITAL Command Language": 15823, "Awk": 11716, "Lua": 11360, "C++": 5647, "Dockerfile": 2412, "CSS": 1868, "Batchfile": 1022, "Ruby": 266, "OpenEdge ABL": 231}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6597080?v=4", "stargazers": 528, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
