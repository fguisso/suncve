The vulnerability is due to incomplete error handling when XML data within a SIP packet is parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a SIP packet that contains a malicious XML payload to an affected phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected phone to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary DoS condition."], "published": "2019-05-03T15:29:00.713", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX", "Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
