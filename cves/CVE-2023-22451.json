In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen."], "published": "2023-01-02T16:15:11.063", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kiwitcms"], "productName": ["Kiwi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-496x-2jqf-hp7g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/3759fb68aed36315cdde9fc573b2fe7c11544985"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["management", "qa", "qa-team", "qatools", "testing", "testing-tools", "testlink", "testopia"], "langs": {"Python": 1059159, "HTML": 230627, "JavaScript": 171886, "Shell": 23307, "CSS": 7677, "Makefile": 5976, "Dockerfile": 2904, "RobotFramework": 1946, "Smarty": 1576, "Ruby": 1339, "Lua": 136}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31894430?v=4", "stargazers": 1020, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
