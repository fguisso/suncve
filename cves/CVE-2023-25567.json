The length of the `av_pair` is not checked properly for two of the elements which can trigger an out-of-bound read. The out-of-bounds read can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point and could cause a denial-of-service if the memory is unmapped. The issue is fixed in version 1.2.0."], "published": "2023-02-14T18:15:13.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gssapi"], "productName": ["gss-ntlmssp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-24pf-6prf-24ch"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/025fbb756d44ffee8f847db4222ed6aa4bd1fbe4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 476794, "M4": 9365, "Makefile": 6335, "Shell": 1817}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63316684?v=4", "stargazers": 31, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
