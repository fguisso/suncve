In versions prior to 6.1.10, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow by providing the Azure RTOS USBX host stack a HUB descriptor with `bNbPorts` set to a value greater than `UX_MAX_TT` which defaults to 8. For a `bNbPorts` value of 255, the implementation of `ux_host_class_hub_descriptor_get` function will modify the contents of `hub` -> `ux_host_class_hub_device` -> `ux_device_hub_tt` array violating the end boundary by 255 - `UX_MAX_TT` items. The USB host stack needs to validate the number of ports reported by the hub, and if the value is larger than UX_MAX_TT, USB stack needs to reject the request. This fix has been included in USBX release 6.1.10."], "published": "2022-05-24T15:15:07.977", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["azure-rtos"], "productName": ["usbx"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-2qc5-385m-x862"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["eclipse-threadx", "embedded", "iot", "mcu", "microcontroller", "rtos", "usb", "usb-hid", "usb-host"], "langs": {"C": 21768724, "CMake": 124455, "Shell": 5999}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156018450?v=4", "stargazers": 180, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
