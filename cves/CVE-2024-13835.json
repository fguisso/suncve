This is due to the plugin not properly verifying the existence of a multisite installation prior to allowing user meta to be added/modified. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to gain elevated privileges on subsites that would otherwise be inaccessible."], "published": "2025-03-08T03:15:36.760", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gandhihitesh9"], "productName": ["Post Meta Data Manager"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
