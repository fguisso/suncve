In versions prior to 0.45.1 an attacker node can cause a victim node to allocate a large number of small memory chunks, which can ultimately lead to the victimâ€™s process running out of memory and thus getting killed by its operating system. When executed continuously, this can lead to a denial of service attack, especially relevant on a larger scale when run against more than one node of a libp2p based network. Users are advised to upgrade to `libp2p` `v0.45.1` or above. Users unable to upgrade should reference the DoS Mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor their application, and respond to attacks: https://docs.libp2p.io/reference/dos-mitigation/."], "published": "2022-12-07T21:15:10.183", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["libp2p"], "productName": ["rust-libp2p"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-jvgw-gccv-q5p8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["decentralization", "libp2p", "networking", "peer-to-peer", "rust"], "langs": {"Rust": 4190272, "Shell": 7200, "Go": 2500, "Dockerfile": 2322, "Python": 1795}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14838238?v=4", "stargazers": 4929, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
