The problem has been patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible. If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `> 1.0.0` make sure that the value is not controlled by another Action."], "published": "2020-10-26T19:15:12.770", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ericcornelissen"], "productName": ["git-tag-annotation-action"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/security/advisories/GHSA-hgx2-4pp9-357g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/commit/9f30756375cc4b1b6c66f274fc9c591fa901455a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["actions", "annotation", "git", "tag"], "langs": {"Shell": 19593, "Makefile": 2194}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3742559?v=4", "stargazers": 4, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
