Prior to the fixed versions,Â `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` do not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` also read config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` directory), this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.\n\n\n\n\n`yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. `youtube-dl` fixes this issue in commit `d42a222` on the `master` branch and in nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output template (`-o \"%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid the generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations."], "published": "2024-07-02T14:15:13.737", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["yt-dlp", "ytdl-org"], "productName": ["yt-dlp", "youtube-dl"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j", "https://github.com/dirkf/youtube-dl/security/advisories/GHSA-22fp-mf44-f2mq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/5ce582448ececb8d9c30c8c31f58330090ced03a", "https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/commit/d42a222ed541b96649396ef00e19552aef0f09ec"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 6383152, "Shell": 8791, "Makefile": 6235, "ActionScript": 4300, "Batchfile": 633}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48381040?v=4", "stargazers": 134985, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
