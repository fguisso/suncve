Prior to 2.4.3, some specifically configured Spin applications that use `self` requests without a specified URL authority can be induced to make requests to arbitrary hosts via the `Host` HTTP header. The following conditions need to be met for an application to be vulnerable: 1. The environment Spin is deployed in routes requests to the Spin runtime based on the request URL instead of the `Host` header, and leaves the `Host` header set to its original value; 2. The Spin application's component handling the incoming request is configured with an `allow_outbound_hosts` list containing `\"self\"`; and 3. In reaction to an incoming request, the component makes an outbound request whose URL doesn't include the hostname/port. Spin 2.4.3 has been released to fix this issue."], "published": "2024-05-08T15:15:10.530", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fermyon"], "productName": ["spin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fermyon/spin/security/advisories/GHSA-f3h7-gpjj-wcvh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fermyon/spin/commit/b3db535c9edb72278d4db3a201f0ed214e561354"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fermyon/spin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["serverless", "spin", "webassembly"], "langs": {"Rust": 3137265, "Makefile": 4027, "HCL": 3306, "Dockerfile": 2447, "Go": 1849, "Nix": 1088, "Shell": 1062, "C": 928, "Zig": 205, "PHP": 30}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/195972566?v=4", "stargazers": 5752, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
