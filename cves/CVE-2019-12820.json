Actions performed on the app such as changing a password, and personal information it communicates with the server, use unencrypted HTTP. As an example, while logging in through the app to a Jisiwei account, the login request is being sent in cleartext. The vulnerability exists in both the Android and iOS version of the app. An attacker could exploit this by using an MiTM attack on the local network to obtain someone's login credentials, which gives them full access to the robot vacuum cleaner."], "published": "2019-07-19T18:15:11.807", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
