Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme."], "published": "2020-10-26T18:15:14.480", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["d0c-s4vage"], "productName": ["lookatme"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/security/advisories/GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/commit/72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ansii", "command-line", "markdown", "markdown-slides", "markdown-viewer", "python", "slides", "terminal", "theme"], "langs": {"Python": 143286, "Shell": 7935}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5090146?v=4", "stargazers": 2186, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
