Due to incomplete filtering in the sanitize_svg function, this can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which in turn pose a risk of remote code execution. The sanitize_svg function only removes script elements and 'on*' event attributes, but does not account for other potential vectors for XSS within SVG files. This vulnerability can be exploited when authorized users access a malicious URL containing the crafted SVG file."], "published": "2024-10-29T13:15:07.840", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/commit/328b960a0de2097e13654ac752253e9541521ddd"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 1449900, "Shell": 30804, "Batchfile": 16275, "HTML": 6350, "Jupyter Notebook": 4229, "C++": 3433, "Dockerfile": 957, "Makefile": 294}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827993?v=4", "stargazers": 288, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
