Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround."], "published": "2022-10-10T21:15:11.213", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["azure-rtos"], "productName": ["usbx"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-chpp-5fv9-6368"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["eclipse-threadx", "embedded", "iot", "mcu", "microcontroller", "rtos", "usb", "usb-hid", "usb-host"], "langs": {"C": 21768724, "CMake": 124455, "Shell": 5999}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156018450?v=4", "stargazers": 180, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
