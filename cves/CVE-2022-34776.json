Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described APIs, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a 'tiny URL' in tabits domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 character long string containing numbers, lower and upper case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information."], "published": "2022-08-22T15:15:16.423", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Tabit "], "productName": ["Tabit "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
