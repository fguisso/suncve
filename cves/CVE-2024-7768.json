This leads the server to repeatedly call its own endpoint, eventually filling up the request queue and leaving the server unable to handle other requests."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:37.133", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["h2oai"], "productName": ["h2oai/h2o-3"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
