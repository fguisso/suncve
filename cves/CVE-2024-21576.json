The issue stems from a validation bypass in the BuildColorRangeHSVAdvanced, FilterContour and FindContour custom nodes. In the entrypoint function to each node, thereâ€™s a call to eval which can be triggered by generating a workflow that injects a crafted string into the node. This can result in executing arbitrary code on the server."], "published": "2024-12-13T12:15:19.753", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["bmad4ever"], "productName": ["ComfyUI-Bmad-Nodes"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
