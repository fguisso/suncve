The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied commands. An attacker who has administrator privileges and access to the network where the IPMI resides could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the affected device."], "published": "2019-08-21T19:15:14.043", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Software (UCSE) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
