Gaining access to that database should\n be difficult and require significant privileges.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts Apache Superset versions 1.5.0 up to and including 2.1.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1 or later.\n\n"], "published": "2023-09-06T14:15:10.483", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Superset"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Barroqueiro/CVE-2023-37941", "https://github.com/Barroqueiro/CVE-2023-37941"]}
