Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious actor could spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests. Versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1 contain a patch. As a workaround, disable the provisioning API."], "published": "2023-08-04T17:15:11.063", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-appservice-bridge"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/security/advisories/GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/commit/4c6723a5e7beda65cdf1ae5dbb882e8beaac8552"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bridge", "library", "matrix", "nodejs"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 412719, "JavaScript": 138053, "Shell": 3563}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 166, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
