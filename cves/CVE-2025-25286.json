Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0, remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally, configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs."], "published": "2025-02-13T01:15:25.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Islandora"], "productName": ["Crayfish"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/commit/64cb4cec688928798cc40e6f0a0e863d7f69fd89"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["islandora"], "langs": {"PHP": 171244, "Shell": 394}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/494054?v=4", "stargazers": 9, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
