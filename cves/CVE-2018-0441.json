The vulnerability is due to a corruption of certain timer mechanisms triggered by specific roaming events. This corruption will eventually cause a timer crash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious reassociation events multiple times to the same AP in a short period of time, causing a DoS condition on the affected AP."], "published": "2018-10-17T22:29:00.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Aironet Access Point Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
