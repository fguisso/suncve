In version 2024.04 and prior, the function `_parse_advertise`, located in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c`, has no minimum header length check for `dhcpv6_opt_t` after processing `dhcpv6_msg_t`. This omission could lead to an out-of-bound read, causing system inconsistency. Additionally, the same lack of a header length check is present in the function `_preparse_advertise`, which is called by `_parse_advertise` before handling the request. As of time of publication, no known patched version exists."], "published": "2024-11-22T16:15:34.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["RIOT-OS"], "productName": ["RIOT"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-xgv3-pcq6-qmrg"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "hacktoberfest", "internet", "internet-of-things", "internetofthings", "iot", "microcontrollers", "os", "riot-os", "riotos", "rtos"], "langs": {"C": 29162636, "C++": 953684, "Makefile": 814677, "Python": 713887, "Linker Script": 67053, "Shell": 28598, "Assembly": 24841, "Rust": 7113, "CMake": 2817, "SmPL": 2591, "Cadence": 887, "Lua": 617, "Vim Snippet": 212, "RenderScript": 33}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3079480?v=4", "stargazers": 5491, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
