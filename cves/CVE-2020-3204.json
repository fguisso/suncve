The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of data passed to the Tcl interpreter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading malicious Tcl code on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory corruption or execute the code with root privileges on the underlying OS of the affected device."], "published": "2020-06-03T18:15:18.197", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS 12.2(53)SE1"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
