It is based on MatrixSDK. Prior to version 1.9.7, events encrypted using Megolm for which trust could not be established did not get decorated accordingly (with warning shields). Therefore a malicious homeserver could inject messages into the room without the user being alerted that the messages were not sent by a verified group member, even if the user has previously verified all group members. This issue has been patched in Element iOS 1.9.7. There are currently no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-11-11T19:15:11.483", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vector-im"], "productName": ["element-ios"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-fm8m-99j7-323g"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Swift": 6887005, "Objective-C": 5322336, "HTML": 130340, "Ruby": 23023, "Shell": 14308, "C": 12306, "JavaScript": 2113, "Jinja": 2090}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13446337?v=4", "stargazers": 1768, "language": "Swift"}}, "pocList": []}
