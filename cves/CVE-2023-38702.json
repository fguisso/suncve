Starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` allows authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does not need any authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect to `/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with low privileges can upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory and gain code execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8."], "published": "2023-08-04T19:15:10.080", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["KnowageLabs"], "productName": ["Knowage-Server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-7mjh-73q3-c3fc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-7mjh-73q3-c3fc", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["analyses", "big-data", "business-intelligence", "data-analysis", "data-mining", "data-visualization", "dataset", "datasource", "fiware", "knowage", "modern-business-analytics", "spagobi", "traditional-sources"], "langs": {"Java": 27002329, "PLpgSQL": 10605459, "JavaScript": 6000212, "HTML": 892483, "SCSS": 384631, "CSS": 101252, "Less": 67102, "API Blueprint": 52344, "Batchfile": 19679, "Python": 15635, "Groovy": 4802, "XSLT": 3900, "R": 3553, "PLSQL": 2499, "TSQL": 1812, "Shell": 89}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27430370?v=4", "stargazers": 418, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
