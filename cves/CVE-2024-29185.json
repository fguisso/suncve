Versions prior to 1.8.128 are vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the /public/tools.php source file. The value of the php_path parameter is being executed as an OS command by the shell_exec function, without validating it. This allows an adversary to execute malicious OS commands on the server. A practical demonstration of the successful command injection attack extracted the /etc/passwd file of the server. This represented the complete compromise of the server hosting the FreeScout application. This attack requires an attacker to know the `App_Key` of the application. This limitation makes the Attack Complexity to be High. If an attacker gets hold of the `App_Key`, the attacker can compromise the Complete server on which the application is deployed. Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue."], "published": "2024-03-22T17:15:08.440", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["freescout-helpdesk"], "productName": ["freescout"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-7p9x-ch4c-vqj9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-7p9x-ch4c-vqj9", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["customer-support", "help-desk", "helpdesk", "helpdesk-ticketing", "helpscout", "laravel", "osticket-alternative", "php", "shared-mailboxes", "support", "ticketing", "ticketing-system", "zendesk", "zendesk-alternative"], "langs": {"PHP": 4318644, "Blade": 449905, "Shell": 16079, "Vue": 563}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/152988407?v=4", "stargazers": 3388, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
