The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the TAPS interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the TAPS interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files in the system."], "published": "2020-04-15T21:15:35.263", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Unified Communications Manager "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
