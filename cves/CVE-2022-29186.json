Rundeck community and rundeck-enterprise docker images contained a pre-generated SSH keypair. If the id_rsa.pub public key of the keypair was copied to authorized_keys files on remote host, those hosts would allow access to anyone with the exposed private credentials. This misconfiguration only impacts Rundeck Docker instances of PagerDutyÂ® Process Automation On Prem (formerly Rundeck) version 4.0 and earlier, not Debian, RPM or .WAR. Additionally, the id_rsa.pub file would have to be copied from the Docker image filesystem contents without overwriting it and used to configure SSH access on a host. A patch on Rundeck's `main` branch has removed the pre-generated SSH key pair, but it does not remove exposed keys that have been configured. To patch, users must run a script on hosts in their environment to search for exposed keys and rotate them. Two workarounds are available: Do not use any pre-existing public key file from the rundeck docker images to allow SSH access by adding it to authorized_keys files and, if you have copied the public key file included in the docker image, remove it from any authorized_keys files."], "published": "2022-05-20T21:15:10.177", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rundeck"], "productName": ["rundeck"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/security/advisories/GHSA-qxjx-xr2m-hgqx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/commit/16ef7a70b202492f9fbb54d8af4bb8ea0afa10ad"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ansible", "audit", "automation", "category-distributed", "deployment", "devops", "devops-team", "devops-tools", "hacktoberfest", "java", "operations", "ops", "orchestration", "runbook", "rundeck", "scheduler", "sre"], "langs": {"Groovy": 13318702, "Java": 4741456, "JavaScript": 2261740, "Vue": 1012257, "TypeScript": 677686, "SCSS": 557900, "Shell": 142181, "CSS": 104870, "Less": 38211, "Dockerfile": 15574, "MDX": 12941, "HTML": 8218, "EJS": 7552, "Makefile": 3562, "Batchfile": 417}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2205640?v=4", "stargazers": 5727, "language": "Groovy"}}, "pocList": []}
