The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL, leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal."], "published": "2024-05-16T09:15:14.543", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mlflow"], "productName": ["mlflow/mlflow"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/f8d51e21523238280ebcfdb378612afd7844eca8"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "apache-spark", "machine-learning", "ml", "mlflow", "model-management"], "langs": {"Python": 13420900, "TypeScript": 4295123, "JavaScript": 2810964, "Java": 290984, "R": 211831, "Scala": 42315, "Shell": 38946, "HTML": 31852, "CSS": 22828, "Dockerfile": 1312, "Mako": 1004, "TSQL": 211}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39938107?v=4", "stargazers": 20047, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
