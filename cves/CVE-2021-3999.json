An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system."], "published": "2022-08-24T16:15:09.077", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["glibc"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
