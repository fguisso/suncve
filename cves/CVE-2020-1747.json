Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor."], "published": "2020-03-24T15:15:12.293", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["PyYAML"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
