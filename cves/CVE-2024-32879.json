Prior to version 5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This issue has been addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field."], "published": "2024-04-24T20:15:07.867", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["python-social-auth"], "productName": ["social-app-django"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/security/advisories/GHSA-2gr8-3wc7-xhj3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/commit/31c3e0c7edb187004d8abbde7e9c4f7ef9098138"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 77556, "HTML": 5}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21279195?v=4", "stargazers": 2069, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
