In Admidio before version 4.0.4, there is an authenticated RCE via .phar file upload. A php web shell can be uploaded via the Documents & Files upload feature. Someone with upload permissions could rename the php shell with a .phar extension, visit the file, triggering the payload for a reverse/bind shell. This can be mitigated by excluding a .phar file extension to be uploaded (like you did with .php .phtml .php5 etc). The vulnerability is patched in version 4.0.4."], "published": "2021-05-20T17:15:07.773", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Admidio"], "productName": ["admidio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-xpqj-67r8-25j2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admidio", "club-management", "documents-manager", "event-management", "lists", "members", "membership", "membership-management", "organization", "photo-album", "php", "user-management"], "langs": {"PHP": 3535695, "JavaScript": 806343, "Smarty": 277323, "CSS": 90577, "HTML": 36415, "Shell": 12215, "Dockerfile": 3454}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9728353?v=4", "stargazers": 369, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
