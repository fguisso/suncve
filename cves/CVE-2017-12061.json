Some variables under user control in the MantisBT installation script are not properly sanitized before being output, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, as demonstrated by the $f_database, $f_db_username, and $f_admin_username variables. This is mitigated by the fact that the admin/ folder should be deleted after installation, and also prevented by CSP."], "published": "2017-08-01T15:29:00.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/17f9b94f031ba93ae2a727bca0e68458ecd08fb0", "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/c73ae3d3d4dd4681489a9e697e8ade785e27cba5"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bugtracker", "hacktoberfest", "mantisbt", "php"], "langs": {"PHP": 4594640, "CSS": 605611, "JavaScript": 286490, "XSLT": 91825, "Python": 27966, "Shell": 9556, "Makefile": 5561, "HTML": 4721, "Dockerfile": 683}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318027?v=4", "stargazers": 1688, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
