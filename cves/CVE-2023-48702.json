Prior to version 10.8.13, the `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint executes an arbitrary file using `ProcessStartInfo` via the `ValidateVersion` function. A malicious administrator can setup a network share and supply a UNC path to `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` which points to an executable on the network share, causing Jellyfin server to run the executable in the local context. The endpoint was removed in version 10.8.13."], "published": "2023-12-13T21:15:07.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jellyfin"], "productName": ["jellyfin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/security/advisories/GHSA-rr9h-w522-cvmr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/commit/83d2c69516471e2db72d9273c6a04247d0f37c86"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["csharp", "dotnet", "jellyfin"], "langs": {"C#": 8235481, "HTML": 20081, "Shell": 3657, "CSS": 329}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45698031?v=4", "stargazers": 38471, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
