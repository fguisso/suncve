This may happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for some time and restart it (**without changing chainID**). A malicious block proposer (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to completely halt the network. This issue is fixed in Tendermint 0.33.6 which checks all the signatures are for the block with 2/3+ majority before creating a commit."], "published": "2020-07-02T17:15:12.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tendermint"], "productName": ["tendermint"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-6jqj-f58p-mrw3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/480b995a31727593f58b361af979054d17d84340"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bft", "blockchain", "consensus", "consistency", "cryptocurrency", "cryptography", "db", "distributed-systems", "go"], "langs": {"Go": 3979011, "TeX": 332482, "TLA": 228722, "Shell": 27771, "Python": 25606, "Makefile": 17042, "Jinja": 13466, "Dockerfile": 6422, "HCL": 2065, "HTML": 787}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7572940?v=4", "stargazers": 5780, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
