These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties\". Hydra does not check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. Exploiting this vulnerability is somewhat difficult because: - TLS protects against MITM which makes it difficult to intercept valid tokens for replay attacks - The expiry time of the JWT gives only a short window of opportunity where it could be replayed This has been patched in version v1.4.0+oryOS.17"], "published": "2020-04-06T17:15:13.367", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ory"], "productName": ["hydra"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ory/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/700d17d3b7d507de1b1d459a7261d6fb2571ebe3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ory/hydra/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["authorization", "cloud", "docker", "federation", "hacktoberfest", "hydra", "identity", "oauth", "oauth-provider", "oauth2", "oauth2-provider", "oauth2-server", "oidc", "openid", "openid-connect", "openid-connect-provider", "openid-provider", "security", "server", "sso"], "langs": {"Go": 1668496, "Ruby": 107106, "JavaScript": 99608, "Shell": 35490, "Makefile": 6865, "Dockerfile": 2517}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25334553?v=4", "stargazers": 16036, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
