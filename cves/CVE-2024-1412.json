This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Note - the issue was partially patched in 1.11.25, but could still potentially be exploited under some circumstances."], "published": "2024-04-09T19:15:16.860", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MemberPress"], "productName": ["Memberpress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
