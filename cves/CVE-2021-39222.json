The Nextcloud Talk application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to patched versions 10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0 or 12.0.0. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy."], "published": "2021-11-15T19:15:07.297", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nextcloud"], "productName": ["security-advisories"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-xhxq-f4vg-jw5g"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cve", "nextcloud", "security", "security-advisories"], "langs": {"PHP": 11445, "Hack": 1058}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19211038?v=4", "stargazers": 63, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
