Please note that Cloud IAAS provider mis-configurations are not Concrete CMS vulnerabilities. A mitigation for this vulnerability is to make sure that the IMDS configurations are according to a cloud provider's best practices.This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0"], "published": "2021-11-19T19:15:08.507", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
