An error state can be generated in the CA UI by a malicious user. This, in turn, allows exploitation of other bugs. This follow-on exploitation can lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution. (This is exploitable only when at least one accessible port lacks a requirement for client certificate authentication. These ports are 8442 or 8080 in a standard installation.)"], "published": "2020-04-08T00:15:11.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
