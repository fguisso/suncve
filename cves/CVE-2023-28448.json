An issue was discovered in the ‘Versionize::deserialize’ implementation provided by the ‘versionize’ crate for ‘vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper', which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The impact started with version 0.1.1. The issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise."], "published": "2023-03-24T20:15:15.613", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["firecracker-microvm"], "productName": ["versionize"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/security/advisories/GHSA-8vxc-r5wp-vgvc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/commit/a57a051ba006cfa3b41a0532f484df759e008d47"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["serialization"], "langs": {"Rust": 100540}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44477506?v=4", "stargazers": 58, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
