The vulnerability could be exploited if an attacker manually crafts an Ignite message containing a vulnerable object whose class is present in the Ignite server classpath and sends it to Ignite server endpoints. Deserialization of such a message by the Ignite server may result in the execution of arbitrary code on the Apache Ignite server side."], "published": "2025-02-14T10:15:09.557", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Ignite"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
