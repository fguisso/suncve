This interface must be password protected, otherwise, the attacker only needs to know the phone number of the device (via an IMSI Catcher, for example) to send administrative commands to the device. These commands can be used to provide ongoing, real-time access to the device and can configure parameters such as IP addresses, firewall rules, and passwords."], "published": "2018-07-24T15:29:00.797", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["CalAmp"], "productName": ["LMU 3030 OBD-II"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
