Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called \"double dots\", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.\n\n"], "published": "2024-01-22T23:15:08.637", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["honojs"], "productName": ["node-server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rjq5-w47x-x359"], "commits": ["https://github.com/honojs/node-server/commit/dd9b9a9b23e3896403c90a740e7f1f0892feb402"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hono", "http-server", "nodejs", "server"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 94875, "JavaScript": 333, "HTML": 45}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98495527?v=4", "stargazers": 465, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
