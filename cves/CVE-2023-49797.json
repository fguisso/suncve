A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to. A user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied: 1. The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`. 2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user's temporary directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`'s builtin symlink check and the deletion itself B: The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory Junctions links. The vulnerability has been addressed in PR #7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller >= 5.13.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-12-09T01:15:07.333", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pyinstaller"], "productName": ["pyinstaller"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/security/advisories/GHSA-9w2p-rh8c-v9g5"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bundle", "package", "py2app", "py2exe", "pyinstaller", "python", "python-3", "python-to-exe"], "langs": {"Python": 3015231, "C": 1309037, "Shell": 10470, "Dockerfile": 2196, "TeX": 2118, "Batchfile": 66, "SWIG": 21}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1215332?v=4", "stargazers": 12261, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
