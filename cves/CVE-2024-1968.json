This behavior contravenes the Fetch standard, which mandates the removal of Authorization headers in cross-origin requests when the scheme, host, or port changes. Consequently, when a redirect downgrades from HTTPS to HTTP, the Authorization header may be inadvertently exposed in plaintext, leading to potential sensitive information disclosure to unauthorized actors. The flaw is located in the _build_redirect_request function of the redirect middleware."], "published": "2024-05-20T08:15:08.850", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["scrapy"], "productName": ["scrapy/scrapy"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/commit/1d0502f25bbe55a22899af915623fda1aaeb9dd8"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["crawler", "crawling", "framework", "hacktoberfest", "python", "scraping", "web-scraping", "web-scraping-python"], "langs": {"Python": 2353613, "HTML": 3290, "Roff": 2010, "Shell": 252}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/733635?v=4", "stargazers": 54786, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
