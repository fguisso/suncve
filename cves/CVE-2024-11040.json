The issue occurs in the 'POST /v1/completions' and 'POST /v1/embeddings' endpoints. For 'POST /v1/completions', enabling 'use_beam_search' and setting 'best_of' to a high value causes the HTTP connection to time out, with vllm ceasing effective work and the request remaining in a 'pending' state, blocking new completion requests. For 'POST /v1/embeddings', supplying invalid inputs to the JSON object causes an issue in the background loop, resulting in all further completion requests returning a 500 HTTP error code ('Internal Server Error') until vllm is restarted."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:23.293", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vllm-project"], "productName": ["vllm-project/vllm"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/gothburz/CVE-2024-11040", "https://github.com/gothburz/CVE-2024-11040"]}
