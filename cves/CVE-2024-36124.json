When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5.\n"], "published": "2024-06-03T15:15:09.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dain"], "productName": ["snappy"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dain/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-8wh2-6qhj-h7j9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dain/snappy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 189082}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58298?v=4", "stargazers": 359, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
