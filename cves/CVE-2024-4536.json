When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink, the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl, also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.\n\nThis feature is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.\n\n"], "published": "2024-05-07T13:15:48.513", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Eclipse Foundation"], "productName": ["EDC"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/commit/a4e6018d2c0457fba6f672fafa6c590513c45d1b"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 8665629, "Shell": 4078, "Dockerfile": 557}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87998832?v=4", "stargazers": 314, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
