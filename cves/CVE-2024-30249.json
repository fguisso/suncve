A vulnerability in versions prior to `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` impacts publicly accessible software depending on the affected versions of Network and allows an attacker to use Network as an amplification vector for a UDP denial of service attack against a third party or as an attempt to trigger service suspension of the host. All consumers of the library should upgrade to at least version `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` to receive a fix. There are no known workarounds beyond updating the library."], "published": "2024-04-04T19:15:08.293", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["CloudburstMC"], "productName": ["Network"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Network/security/advisories/GHSA-6h3m-c6fv-8hvh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Network/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 300834}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34250602?v=4", "stargazers": 48, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
