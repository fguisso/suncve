This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem."], "published": "2022-05-07T04:15:09.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["charmbracelet"], "productName": ["charm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/security/advisories/GHSA-4wpp-w5r4-7v5v"], "commits": ["https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/commit/3c90668f955c7ce5ef721e4fc9faee7053232fd3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["go", "golang"], "langs": {"Go": 252003, "Dockerfile": 347}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57376114?v=4", "stargazers": 2442, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
