The issue arises from the function's handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size."], "published": "2024-07-07T18:15:09.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kjd"], "productName": ["kjd/idna"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/kjd/idna/commit/1d365e17e10d72d0b7876316fc7b9ca0eebdd38d"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/kjd/idna/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dns", "hacktoberfest", "idna", "python", "unicode"], "langs": {"Python": 391223}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34589?v=4", "stargazers": 257, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
