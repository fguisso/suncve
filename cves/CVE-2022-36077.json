In versions prior to 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7, Electron is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information. When following a redirect, Electron delays a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes. The contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as `file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect to that server and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include sending hashed credentials.This issue has been patched in versions: 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7. Users are recommended to upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on('will-redirect')` event, for all WebContents as a workaround."], "published": "2022-11-08T07:15:09.347", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["electron"], "productName": ["electron"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-p2jh-44qj-pf2v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/electron/electron/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c-plus-plus", "chrome", "css", "electron", "html", "javascript", "nodejs", "v8", "works-with-codespaces"], "langs": {"C++": 3900683, "TypeScript": 2231326, "Objective-C++": 392824, "JavaScript": 145343, "Python": 131218, "Objective-C": 41773, "HTML": 12057, "Shell": 8704, "C": 2472, "CSS": 2369}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13409222?v=4", "stargazers": 116233, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
