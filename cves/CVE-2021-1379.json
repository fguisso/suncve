An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP phone or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.Note: Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities."], "published": "2024-11-18T16:15:09.310", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IP Phones with Multiplatform Firmware", "Cisco Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software", "Cisco Small Business IP Phones"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
