When algorithms is not specified in the configuration, with the combination of jwks-rsa, it may lead to authorization bypass. You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply: - You are using express-jwt - You do not have **algorithms** configured in your express-jwt configuration. - You are using libraries such as jwks-rsa as the **secret**. You can fix this by specifying **algorithms** in the express-jwt configuration. See linked GHSA for example. This is also fixed in version 6.0.0."], "published": "2020-06-30T16:15:15.220", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["auth0"], "productName": ["express-jwt"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-6g6m-m6h5-w9gf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt/commit/7ecab5f8f0cab5297c2b863596566eb0c019cdef"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["express-jwt", "jwt"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 27850, "JavaScript": 1419}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2824157?v=4", "stargazers": 4498, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
