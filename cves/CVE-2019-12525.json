When Squid is configured to use Digest authentication, it parses the header Proxy-Authorization. It searches for certain tokens such as domain, uri, and qop. Squid checks if this token's value starts with a quote and ends with one. If so, it performs a memcpy of its length minus 2. Squid never checks whether the value is just a single quote (which would satisfy its requirements), leading to a memcpy of its length minus 1."], "published": "2019-07-11T19:15:13.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
