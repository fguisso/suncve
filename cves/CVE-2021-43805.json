Versions of Solidus prior to 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have a denial of service vulnerability that could be exploited during a guest checkout. The regular expression used to validate a guest order's email was subject to exponential backtracking through a fragment like `a.a.` Versions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a different regular expression. The maintainers added a check for email addresses that are no longer valid that will print information about any affected orders that exist. If a prompt upgrade is not an option, a workaround is available. It is possible to edit the file `config/application.rb` manually (with code provided by the maintainers in the GitHub Security Advisory) to check email validity."], "published": "2021-12-07T18:15:07.407", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["solidusio"], "productName": ["solidus"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/security/advisories/GHSA-qxmr-qxh6-2cc9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/9867153e01e3c3b898cdbcedd7b43375ea922401"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ecommerce", "ecommerce-framework", "ecommerce-platform", "hacktoberfest", "rails", "ruby", "solidus", "storefront"], "langs": {"Ruby": 4018608, "HTML": 604253, "JavaScript": 149105, "SCSS": 75185, "Handlebars": 11544, "Shell": 4701, "Dockerfile": 2093, "CSS": 1209}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11045486?v=4", "stargazers": 5125, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
