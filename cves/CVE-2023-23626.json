When feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of `NewBitfield` and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker can trigger `panic`s. This happen when the `size` is a not a multiple of `8` or is negative. There were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation, however known users of this package are subject to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `size` is a multiple of 8 before calling `NewBitfield` or `FromBytes`."], "published": "2023-02-09T21:15:11.413", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ipfs"], "productName": ["go-bitfield"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/commit/5e1d256fe043fc4163343ccca83862c69c52e579"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 7458}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10536621?v=4", "stargazers": 8, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
