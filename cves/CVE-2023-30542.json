The proposal creation entrypoint (`propose`) in `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` allows the creation of proposals with a `signatures` array shorter than the `calldatas` array. This causes the additional elements of the latter to be ignored, and if the proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would eventually execute without any calldata. The `ProposalCreated` event correctly represents what will eventually execute, but the proposal parameters as queried through `getActions` appear to respect the original intended calldata. This issue has been patched in 4.8.3. As a workaround, ensure that all proposals that pass through governance have equal length `signatures` and `calldatas` parameters."], "published": "2023-04-16T08:15:07.867", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenZeppelin"], "productName": ["openzeppelin-contracts"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-93hq-5wgc-jc82"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ethereum", "evm", "security", "smart-contracts", "solidity"], "langs": {"Solidity": 1339567, "JavaScript": 1293419, "Python": 170892, "Ruby": 95065, "Shell": 9308, "Makefile": 1714}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20820676?v=4", "stargazers": 25643, "language": "Solidity"}}, "pocList": []}
