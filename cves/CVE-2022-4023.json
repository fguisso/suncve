Furthermore the created archive has a predictable location and name, allowing the attacker to download the file if they know the time at which the form was submitted, making it possible to leak sensitive files like the WordPress configuration containing database credentials and secrets."], "published": "2023-07-17T14:15:09.477", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Unknown"], "productName": ["3dprint"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
