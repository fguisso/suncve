Prior to v3.81.9, this vulnerability allows a malicious actor to craft data in a way that, when scanned by specific detectors, could trigger the detector to make an unauthorized request to an endpoint chosen by the attacker. For an exploit to be effective, the target endpoint must be an unauthenticated GET endpoint that produces side effects. The victim must scan the maliciously crafted data and have such an endpoint targeted for the exploit to succeed. The vulnerability has been resolved in TruffleHog v3.81.9 and later versions."], "published": "2024-08-19T15:15:08.683", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["trufflesecurity"], "productName": ["trufflehog"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/security/advisories/GHSA-3r74-v83p-f4f4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/fe5624c70923355128868cffd647b6e2cfe11443"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["credentials", "devsecops", "dynamic-analysis", "hacktoberfest", "precommit", "scanning", "secret", "secret-management", "secrets", "security", "security-tools", "trufflehog", "verification"], "langs": {"Go": 9429425, "Shell": 15060, "Makefile": 1956, "Dockerfile": 621, "Gnuplot": 264}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79229934?v=4", "stargazers": 18681, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
