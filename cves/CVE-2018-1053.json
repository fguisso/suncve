This can allow an authenticated attacker to read or modify the one file, which may contain encrypted or unencrypted database passwords. The attack is infeasible if a directory mode blocks the attacker searching the current working directory or if the prevailing umask blocks the attacker opening the file."], "published": "2018-02-09T14:29:00.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["The PostgreSQL Global Development Group"], "productName": ["postgresql"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
