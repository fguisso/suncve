StorageGRID 11.6.0 obtains the user account status from Active Directory or Azure and will block S3 access for disabled user accounts during the subsequent background synchronization. User accounts that are expired or locked for Active Directory or Azure, or user accounts that are disabled, expired, or locked in identity sources other than Active Directory or Azure must be manually removed from group memberships or have their S3 keys manually removed from Tenant Manager in all versions of StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale)."], "published": "2022-03-04T18:15:08.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
