This is due to the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible."], "published": "2024-08-28T07:15:11.413", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["funnelforms"], "productName": ["Interactive Contact Form and Multi Step Form Builder with Drag & Drop Editor â€“ Funnelforms Free"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
