A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions 15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it."], "published": "2021-10-12T19:15:07.987", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["electron"], "productName": ["electron"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-mpjm-v997-c4h4"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/electron/electron/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c-plus-plus", "chrome", "css", "electron", "html", "javascript", "nodejs", "v8", "works-with-codespaces"], "langs": {"C++": 3900683, "TypeScript": 2231326, "Objective-C++": 392824, "JavaScript": 145343, "Python": 131218, "Objective-C": 41773, "HTML": 12057, "Shell": 8704, "C": 2472, "CSS": 2369}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13409222?v=4", "stargazers": 116233, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
