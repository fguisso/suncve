An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute code in the context of another local user.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker would need to modify Git configuration files on a system prior to a full installation of the application. The attacker would then need to convince another user on the system to execute specific Git commands.\nThe update addresses the issue by changing the permissions required to edit configuration files.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:18.347", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Microsoft Visual Studio 2017", "Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9 (includes 15.0 - 15.8)", "Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 version 16.0", "Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
