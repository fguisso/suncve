Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. This has been patched in versions 1.11.10, 1.12.8, 1.13.7, 1.14.6, 1.15.3 and 1.16.2"], "published": "2020-03-10T18:15:12.203", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dojo"], "productName": ["dojox"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dojo/dojox/security/advisories/GHSA-3hw5-q855-g6cw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dojo/dojox/commit/47d1b302b5b23d94e875b77b9b9a8c4f5622c9da"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dojo/dojox/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 10418257, "HTML": 8492813, "CSS": 1211556, "Less": 374891, "PHP": 182756, "XSLT": 47383, "ActionScript": 21154, "Perl": 6881, "Java": 1391, "Shell": 1261, "Batchfile": 866, "XQuery": 799, "Roff": 228}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86896?v=4", "stargazers": 152, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
