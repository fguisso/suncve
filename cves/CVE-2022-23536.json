A local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Cortex versions 1.13.0, 1.13.1 and 1.14.0, where a malicious actor could remotely read local files as a result of parsing maliciously crafted Alertmanager configurations when submitted to the Alertmanager Set Configuration API. Only users of the Alertmanager service where `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` or `enable_api: true` is configured are affected. Affected Cortex users are advised to upgrade to patched versions 1.13.2 or 1.14.1. However as a workaround, Cortex administrators may reject Alertmanager configurations containing the `api_key_file` setting in the `opsgenie_configs` section before sending to the Set Alertmanager Configuration API."], "published": "2022-12-19T22:15:10.803", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["cortexproject"], "productName": ["cortex"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/security/advisories/GHSA-cq2g-pw6q-hf7j"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "hacktoberfest", "kubernetes", "monitoring", "prometheus"], "langs": {"Go": 6994616, "Makefile": 18584, "Shell": 17614, "HTML": 11942, "Dockerfile": 6112, "SCSS": 3000, "PLpgSQL": 781}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43045022?v=4", "stargazers": 5562, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
