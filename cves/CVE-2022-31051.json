In affected versions secrets that would normally be masked by semantic-release can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that are excluded from uri encoding by `encodeURI`. Occurrence is further limited to execution contexts where push access to the related repository is not available without modifying the repository url to inject credentials. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that secrets that do not contain characters that are excluded from encoding with `encodeURI` when included in a URL are already masked properly."], "published": "2022-06-09T20:15:08.400", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["semantic-release"], "productName": ["semantic-release"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/security/advisories/GHSA-x2pg-mjhr-2m5x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/58a226f29c04ee56bbb02cc661f020d568849cad"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["automation", "changelog", "package", "publish", "release", "release-automation", "release-workflow", "semantic-release", "semantic-version", "semver", "semver-release", "version"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 388841}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12867925?v=4", "stargazers": 21700, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
