An upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature forgery attack. All places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.2.\n"], "published": "2023-10-26T15:15:09.087", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["browserify"], "productName": ["browserify-sign"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/browserify/browserify-sign/security/advisories/GHSA-x9w5-v3q2-3rhw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/browserify/browserify-sign/commit/85994cd6348b50f2fd1b73c54e20881416f44a30"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/browserify/browserify-sign/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 15908}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6320506?v=4", "stargazers": 46, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
