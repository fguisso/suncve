By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround."], "published": "2023-06-07T18:15:09.977", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenZeppelin"], "productName": ["openzeppelin-contracts"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-5h3x-9wvq-w4m2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/d9474327a492f9f310f31bc53f38dbea56ed9a57"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ethereum", "evm", "security", "smart-contracts", "solidity"], "langs": {"Solidity": 1339567, "JavaScript": 1293419, "Python": 170892, "Ruby": 95065, "Shell": 9308, "Makefile": 1714}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20820676?v=4", "stargazers": 25643, "language": "Solidity"}}, "pocList": []}
