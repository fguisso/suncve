There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. The filter to detect and prevent the use of the `javascript:` URL scheme in the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag could be bypassed with tab `\\t` or newline `\\n` characters between the characters of the protocol, e.g. `java\\tscript:`. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.1, 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.7.2, 1.6.3, 1.5.3, and 1.4.2. Configuring a Content Security Policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline` would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited."], "published": "2024-04-17T16:15:09.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["phlex-ruby"], "productName": ["phlex"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/9e3f5b980655817993682e409cbda72956d865cb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["component-architecture", "component-library", "phlex", "ruby", "server-side-rendering", "ssr", "ui-components", "view-components"], "langs": {"Ruby": 151149, "Shell": 255}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111233186?v=4", "stargazers": 1383, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
