Prior to version 0.36.0, there is a possible consensus split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain. Because the developers represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s, there is an issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain. In those cases, Lodestar may view valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as invalid, due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus split, where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network. Similarly, Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as valid, thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases, so one may carefully use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus."], "published": "2022-05-24T15:15:07.843", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ChainSafe"], "productName": ["lodestar"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/security/advisories/GHSA-cvj7-5f3c-9vg9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/security/advisories/GHSA-cvj7-5f3c-9vg9", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["beacon-chain", "blockchain", "eth2", "ethereum", "proof-of-stake", "serenity", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 6202336, "JavaScript": 46881, "Shell": 22985, "Dockerfile": 4364}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27474093?v=4", "stargazers": 1267, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
