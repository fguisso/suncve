Prior to versions 2.6.10, 2.10.7, 2.14.5, 3.0.2, 3.1.2, and 3.2.0, per design, PermissionsCA is not full chain validated, nor is the expiration date validated. Access control plugin validates only the S/MIME signature which causes an expired PermissionsCA to be taken as valid. Even though this issue is responsible for allowing `governance/permissions` from an expired PermissionsCA and having the system crash when PermissionsCA is not self-signed and contains the full-chain, the impact is low. Versions 2.6.10, 2.10.7, 2.14.5, 3.0.2, 3.1.2, and 3.2.0 contain a fix for the issue."], "published": "2025-02-11T16:15:51.190", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["eProsima"], "productName": ["Fast-DDS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-w33g-jmm2-8983"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-w33g-jmm2-8983", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cpp", "dds", "fastdds", "middleware", "omg", "robotics", "ros2", "rtps"], "langs": {"C++": 47388003, "C": 9849654, "CMake": 590230, "Python": 298645, "CSS": 28054, "Shell": 13986, "Makefile": 5345, "HTML": 2698, "Dockerfile": 1683, "Batchfile": 1395, "PowerShell": 954}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6390783?v=4", "stargazers": 2363, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
