The Ansible extension is unaffected. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because it is exploitable only in conjunction with hypothetical other factors, i.e., an affected use case within a library caller, and a bug in the message receiver policy code that led to reliance on this extra protection mechanism."], "published": "2019-08-18T20:15:09.220", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/dw/mitogen/commit/5924af1566763e48c42028399ea0cd95c457b3dc"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/dw/mitogen/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ansible", "devops", "infrastructure", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 1260447, "Shell": 7391, "Jinja": 5224, "Perl": 530, "Makefile": 428, "C": 397}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77410951?v=4", "stargazers": 2377, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
