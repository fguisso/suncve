A DLL hijacking vulnerability in Rufus 4.6.2208 and earlier versions allows an attacker loading and executing a malicious DLL with escalated privileges (since the executable has been granted higher privileges during the time of launch) due to the ability to inject a malicious `cfgmgr32.dll` in the same directory as the executable and have it side load automatically. This is fixed in commit `74dfa49`, which will be part of version 4.7. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as version 4.7 becomes available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2025-02-18T23:15:10.810", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pbatard"], "productName": ["rufus"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/security/advisories/GHSA-p8p5-r296-g2jv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/74dfa49707fd626b58d776d3400295740a29e23e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bios", "boot", "bootable-drives", "freedos", "gpt", "grub", "grub4dos", "iso", "mbr", "md5", "persistence", "rufus", "secure-boot", "sha1", "sha256", "syslinux", "uefi", "usb", "windows", "windows-to-go"], "langs": {"C": 4021359, "C++": 456953, "Makefile": 268182, "C#": 53583, "Shell": 38674, "Assembly": 23281, "PowerShell": 14216, "Batchfile": 8907, "Python": 6889, "M4": 3325, "sed": 536, "Linker Script": 176}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1206968?v=4", "stargazers": 30839, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
