There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the `content_security_policy` helper starting in version 5.2.0 of Action Pack and prior to versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1. Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from untrusted user input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against XSS and other attacks. Versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input."], "published": "2024-12-10T23:15:06.240", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rails"], "productName": ["rails"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-vfm5-rmrh-j26v"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2e3f41e4538b9ca1044357f6644f037bbb7c6c49", "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3da2479cfe1e00177114b17e496213c40d286b3a", "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5558e72f22fc69c1c407b31ac5fb3b4ce087b542", "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/cb16a3bb515b5d769f73926d9757270ace691f1d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rails/rails/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activejob", "activerecord", "framework", "html", "mvc", "rails", "ruby"], "langs": {"Ruby": 17256286, "JavaScript": 228123, "HTML": 196993, "SCSS": 50596, "CSS": 46738, "Dockerfile": 2019, "Shell": 810}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4223?v=4", "stargazers": 56700, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
