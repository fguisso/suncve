The vulnerability is due to insufficient access restriction to ports necessary for system operation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting an unauthorized network device to the subnet designated for cluster services. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to reach internal services that are not hardened for external access."], "published": "2019-06-20T03:15:11.917", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
