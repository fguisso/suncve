A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting Iframe Dialog and Media Embed packages. The vulnerability may trigger a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions: using one of the affected packages on a web page with missing proper Content Security Policy configuration; initializing the editor on an element and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base; and destroying the editor instance. This vulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism.\n\nA fix is available in CKEditor4 version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may be considered a breaking change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the Iframe Dialog plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this behavior, configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also starting from version 4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this behavior, configure the `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option. Those who choose to enable either of the more permissive options or who cannot upgrade to a patched version should properly configure Content Security Policy to avoid any potential security issues that may arise from embedding iframe elements on their web page."], "published": "2023-03-22T21:15:18.607", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ckeditor"], "productName": ["ckeditor4"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-vh5c-xwqv-cv9g"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ckeditor", "ckeditor4", "contenteditable", "html-editor", "rich-text-editor", "rte", "wysiwyg"], "langs": {"Rich Text Format": 179759729, "HTML": 25244344, "JavaScript": 11653753, "CSS": 291415, "Shell": 9678, "Python": 2436}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825710?v=4", "stargazers": 5802, "language": "Rich Text Format"}}, "pocList": []}
