A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability. This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`."], "published": "2022-11-02T13:15:13.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluent"], "productName": ["fluentd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-fppq-mj76-fpj2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/commit/48e5b85dab1b6d4c273090d538fc11b3f2fd8135"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "data-collector", "fluentd", "logging", "ruby"], "langs": {"Ruby": 3405093, "HTML": 7515}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/859518?v=4", "stargazers": 13095, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
