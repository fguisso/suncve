If an attacker has access to the data source, the leaked token could be used to authenticate to Grafana.\n\n"], "published": "2023-04-26T14:15:09.430", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Grafana"], "productName": ["Grafana", "Grafana Enterprise"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/grafana/bugbounty/security/advisories/GHSA-5585-m9r5-p86j"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/grafana/bugbounty/security/advisories/GHSA-5585-m9r5-p86j", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/grafana/bugbounty/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bounty", "bug", "bugbounty", "grafana", "rewards", "security"], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195757?v=4", "stargazers": 29, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
