This vulnerability occurs due to insufficient sanitization of PixelFormat. Since remote attacker can choose offset from start of the buffer to start writing his values, exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity."], "published": "2019-12-26T16:15:10.793", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Kaspersky"], "productName": ["TigerVNC"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/CendioOssman/tigervnc/commit/05e28490873a861379c943bf616614b78b558b89"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/CendioOssman/tigervnc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C++": 2135732, "Java": 1745894, "C": 1010134, "CMake": 71060, "Roff": 50918, "Makefile": 32462, "Objective-C++": 17771, "Perl": 12443, "Shell": 11196, "Objective-C": 1754, "Python": 1378}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6640916?v=4", "stargazers": 11, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
