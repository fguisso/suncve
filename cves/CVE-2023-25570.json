Prior to version 2.1.0, there are potential security issues if users expose apollo-configservice to the internet, which is not recommended. This is because there is no authentication feature enabled for the built-in eureka service. Malicious hackers may access eureka directly to mock apollo-configservice and apollo-adminservice. Login authentication for eureka was added in version 2.1.0. As a workaround, avoid exposing apollo-configservice to the internet."], "published": "2023-02-20T16:15:10.593", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["apolloconfig"], "productName": ["apollo"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-368x-wmmg-hq5c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/commit/7df79bf8df6960433ed4ff782a54e3dfc74632bd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["config-management", "configuration-management", "distributed-configuration", "microservices", "spring-boot", "spring-cloud"], "langs": {"Java": 2638715, "HTML": 533731, "JavaScript": 435983, "Shell": 45513, "CSS": 23489, "Dockerfile": 6482, "Batchfile": 2286}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83490506?v=4", "stargazers": 29417, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
