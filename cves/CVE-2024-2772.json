This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Fluent Forms settings, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This can be chained with CVE-2024-2771 for a low-privileged user to inject malicious web scripts."], "published": "2024-05-18T08:15:07.393", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["techjewel"], "productName": ["Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag & Drop WP Form Builder"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
