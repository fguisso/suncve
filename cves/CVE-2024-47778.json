An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in gst_wavparse_adtl_chunk within gstwavparse.c. This vulnerability arises due to insufficient validation of the size parameter, which can exceed the bounds of the data buffer. As a result, an OOB read occurs in the following while loop. This vulnerability can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:40.840", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
