Header\n\n2. Data\n\nWhen a connection is made, the server is waiting for 4 bytes of data, which will be the header,\nand these 4 bytes would be parsed as uint32 size of the actual data to come.\n\nThen, in the function “handleRequest” this size is then used in order to allocate a payload on\nthe stack for the incoming data.\n\nAs this payload is allocated on the stack, this will allow overflowing the stack size allocated for\nthe relevant process with freely controlled data.\n\n* An attacker can crash the system. \n* An attacker can gain control over the system, specifically on the “vtpm_server” process\nwhich has very high privileges.\n\n\n"], "published": "2023-09-21T14:15:11.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": [" LF-Edge, Zededa"], "productName": ["EVE OS"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
