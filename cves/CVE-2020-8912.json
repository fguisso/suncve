An attacker with write access to the targeted bucket can change the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can then allow them to change AES-GCM to AES-CTR. Using this in combination with a decryption oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as decrypting the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an algebraic equation. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files."], "published": "2020-08-11T20:15:13.323", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Google LLC"], "productName": ["AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-7f33-f4f5-xwgw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-7f33-f4f5-xwgw", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/google/security-research/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 3261224, "Python": 153144, "Shell": 123520, "Go": 122474, "TypeScript": 84926, "Makefile": 59334, "Assembly": 49813, "Java": 31234, "CSS": 23622, "CodeQL": 18092, "Dockerfile": 13547, "HTML": 6938, "C++": 6653, "JavaScript": 3944, "GDB": 811, "PHP": 556}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342004?v=4", "stargazers": 3851, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
