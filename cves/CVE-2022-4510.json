By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction,Â would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.\n This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py.\n\nThis issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.\n\n"], "published": "2023-01-26T21:18:06.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Refirm Labs"], "productName": ["binwalk"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/electr0sm0g/CVE-2022-4510", "https://github.com/adhikara13/CVE-2022-4510-WalkingPath", "https://github.com/Kalagious/BadPfs-CVE-2022-4510", "https://github.com/electr0sm0g/CVE-2022-4510", "https://github.com/adhikara13/CVE-2022-4510-WalkingPath", "https://github.com/Kalagious/BadPfs-CVE-2022-4510"]}
