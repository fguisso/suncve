Prior to 5.5.1 - 239, a file upload vulnerability exists in the Manage Playlist functionality of the application, specifically surrounding the uploading of playlist cover images. Without proper checks, an attacker can upload a PHP script file instead of an image file, thus allowing a webshell or other malicious files to be stored and executed on the server. This attack vector exists in both the admin area and low-level user area. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 239."], "published": "2025-01-07T16:15:40.853", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MacWarrior"], "productName": ["clipbucket-v5"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/893bfb0f1236c4a59b5e2843ab8d27a1e491b12b"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 7664971, "PHP": 3550064, "HTML": 1182994, "CSS": 344123, "Shell": 27670, "Batchfile": 18078, "Hack": 1729, "Roff": 2}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200590?v=4", "stargazers": 112, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
