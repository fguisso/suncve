OnlineVotingSystem before version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without a salt, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt, it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords. This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect passwords stored in the voting system."], "published": "2021-01-21T15:15:14.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dbijaya"], "productName": ["OnlineVotingSystem"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem/security/advisories/GHSA-wwg8-372v-v332"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem/commit/0181cb0272857696c8eb3e44fcf6cb014ff90f09"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["java", "jsp", "mvc-pattern", "rsa", "servlet", "servlet-jsp", "sha256"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 195855, "Java": 67897, "CSS": 737}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48244637?v=4", "stargazers": 3, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
