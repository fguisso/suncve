This issue is present in all versions of the application. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient path sanitization for the 'project-name' parameter, enabling attackers to specify paths that traverse the filesystem. By setting 'project-name' to the root directory, an attacker can cause the application to attempt to read the entire filesystem, leading to a DoS condition."], "published": "2024-06-30T01:15:09.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stitionai"], "productName": ["stitionai/devika"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
