An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.\nThe update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:15.937", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 7", "Windows 7 Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2008  Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Systems Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
