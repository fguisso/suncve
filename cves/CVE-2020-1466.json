An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the RD Gateway service on the target system to stop responding.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to run a specially crafted application against a server which provides RD Gateway services.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how RD Gateway handles connection requests.\n"], "published": "2020-08-17T19:15:14.927", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012", "Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012 R2", "Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
