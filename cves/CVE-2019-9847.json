If the hyperlink is activated by the victim the executable target is unconditionally launched. Under Windows and macOS when processing a hyperlink target explicitly activated by the user there was no judgment made on whether the target was an executable file, so such executable targets were launched unconditionally. This issue affects: All LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions prior to 6.1.6; LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions in the 6.2 series prior to 6.2.3."], "published": "2019-05-09T14:29:00.697", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Document Foundation"], "productName": ["LibreOffice"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
