This leads to an Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability which allows attackers to access the application source code. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the retrieved source code is only the DevExpress client-side application code that is, of course, intentionally readable by web browsers (a site's custom code and data is never accessible via an IDOR approach)."], "published": "2022-10-18T14:15:09.807", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
