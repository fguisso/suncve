The location of these stored responses is constructed from the URL of the request. Due to insufficient sanitation of the URL, it is possible for an attacker to craft a URL that results in the response being stored outside of the directory specified for it."], "published": "2023-09-13T15:15:07.837", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["NLnet Labs"], "productName": ["Routinator"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
