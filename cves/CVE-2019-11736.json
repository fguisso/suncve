Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access. <br>*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*.
