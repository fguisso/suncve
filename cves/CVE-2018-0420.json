The issue is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames and pathnames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view system files on the targeted device, which may contain sensitive information."], "published": "2018-10-17T22:29:00.457", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
