This resulted in using ids other than the intended ones in the lower fs, which likely did not map into the shifts s_user_ns. A local attacker could use this to possibly bypass discretionary access control permissions."], "published": "2020-04-24T00:15:11.840", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Ubuntu"], "productName": ["Shiftfs in the Linux kernel"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
