Starting with version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, users who expected their `multiselect` fields to use the field-level access control - if configured - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used. List-level access control is not affected. Field-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are not affected. Version 2.3.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, stop using the `multiselect` field."], "published": "2022-10-25T17:15:56.020", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["keystonejs"], "productName": ["keystone"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-6mhr-52mv-6v6f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/commit/65c6ee3deef23605fc72b80230908696a7a65e7c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "cms-framework", "graphql", "keystonejs", "nodejs", "react"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2216799, "JavaScript": 21500, "HTML": 5178}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6118534?v=4", "stargazers": 9496, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
