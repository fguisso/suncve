This pure-Python implementation uses AF_INET or \nAF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. The connection \nbetween the two sockets was not verified before passing the two sockets \nback to the user, which leaves the server socket vulnerable to a \nconnection race from a malicious local peer.\n\nPlatforms that support AF_UNIX such as Linux and macOS are not affected by this vulnerability. Versions prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due to the vulnerable API not being included."], "published": "2024-07-29T22:15:04.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Python Software Foundation"], "productName": ["CPython"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/06fa244666ec6335a3b9bf2367e31b42b9a89b20", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/0b65c8bf5367625673eafb92f85046a1b31259f2", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/220e31adeaaa8436c9ff234cba1398bc49e2bb6c", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/5f90abaa786f994db3907fc31e2ee00ea2cf0929", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b252317956b7fc035bb3774ef6a177e227f9fc54", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/2621a8a40ba4b2c68ca564671b7daa5da80a4508", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/5df322e91a40909e6904bbdbc0c3a6b6a9eead39", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c21a36112a0028d7ac3cf8f480e0dc88dba5922c", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/f071f01b7b7e19d7d6b3a4b0ec62f820ecb14660", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/31302f5fc24eecd693f0c8aaba7c2840b09b594d", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/3f5d9d12c74787fbf3f5891835c85cc15526c86d", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c5655aa6ad120d2ed7f255bebd6e8b71a9c07dde", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e319f774f9e766a2b92949444a2d46081df3363a", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/78df1043dbdce5c989600616f9f87b4ee72944e5"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/python/cpython/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 36258679, "C": 20933037, "C++": 465749, "M4": 259559, "HTML": 188474, "Batchfile": 78535, "Shell": 71242, "Roff": 49943, "Makefile": 36812, "Objective-C": 33055, "Common Lisp": 24579, "PLSQL": 22886, "PowerShell": 20323, "Rich Text Format": 6905, "JavaScript": 4489, "Kotlin": 3800, "Assembly": 2552, "DTrace": 2196, "CSS": 1325, "XSLT": 1174, "CMake": 419, "VBScript": 70}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525981?v=4", "stargazers": 66147, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
