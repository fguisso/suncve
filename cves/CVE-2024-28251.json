Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-03-14T00:15:33.630", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pinterest"], "productName": ["querybook"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-5349-j4c9-x767"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["analyses", "celery", "charting", "flask", "hive", "metastore", "notebook", "presto", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2623626, "Python": 1410681, "SCSS": 193957, "MDX": 170543, "JavaScript": 107305, "Shell": 5592, "Dockerfile": 2516, "Makefile": 1974, "HTML": 1532, "Mustache": 1283, "Mako": 494, "CSS": 482}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/541152?v=4", "stargazers": 2071, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
