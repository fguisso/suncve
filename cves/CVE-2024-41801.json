Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the \"Login required\" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers. Version 14.3.0 includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname. Users who aren't able to upgrade immediately may use mod_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in their proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject. Alternatively, they can manually apply the patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject."], "published": "2024-07-25T17:15:11.423", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["opf"], "productName": ["openproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-g92v-vrq6-4fpw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["angular", "bcf", "boards", "bug-tracker", "gantt", "gantt-chart", "ifc", "issue-tracker", "kanban", "openproject", "project-management", "project-planning", "roadmap", "ruby", "scrum", "timeline", "workflows"], "langs": {"Ruby": 27773153, "TypeScript": 4615741, "HTML": 2723705, "Sass": 675223, "JavaScript": 115874, "Nix": 99153, "Shell": 91515, "SCSS": 14989, "API Blueprint": 13533, "CSS": 10185, "Perl": 9453, "Dockerfile": 8657, "Procfile": 132}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756674?v=4", "stargazers": 10287, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
