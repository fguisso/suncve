An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4."], "published": "2021-04-30T19:15:07.143", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Exiv2"], "productName": ["exiv2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-5p8g-9xf3-gfrr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/commit/783b3a6ff15ed6f82a8f8e6c8a6f3b84a9b04d4b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cli", "exif", "exif-interface", "exif-metadata", "image-metadata", "iptc", "iptc-metadata", "xmp", "xmp-metadata"], "langs": {"C++": 4300067, "Python": 937903, "CMake": 61321, "C": 35700, "Meson": 13772, "Shell": 8085, "Batchfile": 914, "CodeQL": 599, "QMake": 392, "sed": 370}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23559442?v=4", "stargazers": 995, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
