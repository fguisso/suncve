An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject code into a CAB file without invalidating the file's signature.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could modify a signed CAB file and inject malicious code. The attacker could then convince a target user to execute the file.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:15.703", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1703", "Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows Server, version 1803  (Server Core Installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1507", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
