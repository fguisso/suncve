This is due to the passphrase and iv being hardcoded in the 'pm_encrypt_decrypt_pass' function and used across all sites running the plugin. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions or above to decrypt and view users' passwords. If combined with another vulnerability, this can potentially grant lower-privileged users access to users' passwords."], "published": "2023-08-31T06:15:09.860", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["metagauss"], "productName": ["ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles, Memberships, Groups and Communities"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
