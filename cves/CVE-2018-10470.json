An attacker can maliciously craft a fat binary containing multiple architectures that may cause a situation where Little Snitch treats the running process as having no code signature at all while erroneously indicating that the binary on disk does have a valid code signature. This could lead to users being confused about whether or not the code signature is valid."], "published": "2018-06-12T17:29:00.207", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Objective Development Software GmbH"], "productName": ["Little Snitch"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
