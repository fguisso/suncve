The vulnerability is due to the logging of certain TCP packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition. The success of an exploit is dependent on how an administrator has configured logging for SSL policies for a device. This vulnerability affects Cisco FirePOWER System Software that is configured to log connections by using SSL policy default actions.
