Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered."], "published": "2022-03-03T20:15:07.997", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["github"], "productName": ["cmark-gfm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-mc3g-88wq-6f4x"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 768727, "C++": 201370, "Python": 50409, "CMake": 22945, "XSLT": 11938, "Racket": 8625, "Makefile": 7169, "Shell": 899, "Dockerfile": 820, "Perl": 525, "Ruby": 316, "Batchfile": 294, "JavaScript": 102}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4", "stargazers": 953, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
