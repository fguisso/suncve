This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary option values on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to delete an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users. Note: This issue can also be used to add arbitrary options with an empty value."], "published": "2024-11-13T02:15:14.450", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wpmonks"], "productName": ["Styler for Ninja Forms"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
