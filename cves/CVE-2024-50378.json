While this risk is limited to users with audit log access, it is recommended to upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or a later version, which addresses this issue. Users who previously used the CLI to set secret variables should manually delete entries with those variables from the log table."], "published": "2024-11-08T15:15:06.143", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Airflow"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
