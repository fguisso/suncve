This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update limited arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the Subscriber role with Administrator-level capabilities to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. The vulnerability is limited in that the option updated must have a value that is an array."], "published": "2024-11-19T12:15:16.497", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["techlabpro1"], "productName": ["Classified Listing – Classified ads & Business Directory Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
