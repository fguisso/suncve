Prior to version 1.4.1 Running `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct that has a field of type `[]struct{...}` opens it up to malicious attacks regarding memory allocations, taking advantage of the sparse slice functionality. Any use of `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with arrays of other structs could be vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. Version 1.4.1 contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2024-07-01T19:15:04.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gorilla"], "productName": ["schema"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gorilla/schema/security/advisories/GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gorilla/schema/commit/cd59f2f12cbdfa9c06aa63e425d1fe4a806967ff"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/gorilla/schema/security/advisories/GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/gorilla/schema/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["encoder", "forms", "go", "golang", "gorilla", "gorilla-web-toolkit", "http", "schema"], "langs": {"Go": 113180, "Makefile": 950}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/489566?v=4", "stargazers": 1416, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
