Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the `/<camera_name>` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch for this issue."], "published": "2023-10-30T23:15:08.620", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["blakeblackshear"], "productName": ["frigate"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-jjxc-m35j-p56f"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "camera", "google-coral", "home-assistant", "home-automation", "homeautomation", "mqtt", "nvr", "object-detection", "realtime", "rtsp", "tensorflow"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1728199, "Python": 1566519, "CSS": 29455, "Shell": 20018, "Dockerfile": 15861, "JavaScript": 9011, "Makefile": 6148, "HCL": 4188, "Jupyter Notebook": 2329, "HTML": 2323}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569905?v=4", "stargazers": 21890, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
