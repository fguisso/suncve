Combining two molecules to one another, called \"cross-linking\" results in a molecule with a chemical formula that is composed of all atoms of the original two molecules. In Fabric, one can take a block of transactions and cross-link the transactions in a way that alters the way the peers parse the transactions. If a first peer receives a block B and a second peer receives a block identical to B but with the transactions being cross-linked, the second peer will parse transactions in a different way and thus its world state will deviate from the first peer. Orderers or peers cannot detect that a block has its transactions cross-linked, because there is a vulnerability in the way Fabric hashes the transactions of blocks. It simply and naively concatenates them, which is insecure and lets an adversary craft a \"cross-linked block\" (block with cross-linked transactions) which alters the way peers process transactions. For example, it is possible to select a transaction and manipulate a peer to completely avoid processing it, without changing the computed hash of the block. Additional validations have been added in v2.2.14 and v2.5.5 to detect potential cross-linking issues before processing blocks. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-11-14T21:15:11.003", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["hyperledger"], "productName": ["fabric"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/security/advisories/GHSA-v9w2-543f-h69m"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/security/advisories/GHSA-v9w2-543f-h69m", "kw": ["poc", "payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blockchain", "confidentiality", "consensus", "distributed-ledger", "fabric", "hyperledger"], "langs": {"Go": 11872521, "Shell": 69870, "Makefile": 19327, "Dockerfile": 8735}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7657900?v=4", "stargazers": 16034, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
