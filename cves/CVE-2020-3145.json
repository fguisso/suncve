The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user."], "published": "2020-07-16T18:15:16.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router Firmware "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
