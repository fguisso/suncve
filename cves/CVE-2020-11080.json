The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection."], "published": "2020-06-03T23:15:11.073", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nghttp2"], "productName": ["nghttp2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-q5wr-xfw9-q7xr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/336a98feb0d56b9ac54e12736b18785c27f75090", "https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/f8da73bd042f810f34d19f9eae02b46d870af394"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-q5wr-xfw9-q7xr", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "cpp20", "http2", "http3", "quic"], "langs": {"C++": 2296822, "C": 1687261, "Go": 180875, "Python": 90018, "M4": 74789, "CMake": 67375, "Makefile": 23972, "Shell": 9762, "Dockerfile": 6966, "Ruby": 559}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16933524?v=4", "stargazers": 4742, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
