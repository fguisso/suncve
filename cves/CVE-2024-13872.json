Updates can be remotely triggered through the /set_temp_token API method. Then, an unauthenticated and network-adjacent attacker can use man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques to return malicious responses. Restarted daemons that use malicious assets can then be exploited for remote code execution on the device."], "published": "2025-03-12T12:15:14.273", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Bitdefender"], "productName": ["BOX v1"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
