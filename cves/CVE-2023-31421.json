More specifically, when the client is configured to connect to an IP address (instead of a hostname) it does not validate the server certificate's IP SAN values against that IP address and certificate validation fails, and therefore the connection is not blocked as expected."], "published": "2023-10-26T04:15:16.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Elastic"], "productName": ["Beats", "Elastic Agent", "APM Server", "Fleet Server"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
