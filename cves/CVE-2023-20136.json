The attacker would need valid user credentials.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) of certain OpenAPI operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a crafted OpenAPI function call with valid credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute OpenAPI operations that are reserved for the Administrator user, including the creation and deletion of user labels."], "published": "2023-06-28T15:15:09.820", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Secure Workload"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
