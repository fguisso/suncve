In affected versions a security issue has been discovered with the custom GeoJSON map (`admin->settings->maps->custom maps->add a map`) support and potential local file inclusion (including environment variables). URLs were not validated prior to being loaded. This issue is fixed in a new maintenance release (0.40.5 and 1.40.5), and any subsequent release after that. If youâ€™re unable to upgrade immediately, you can mitigate this by including rules in your reverse proxy or load balancer or WAF to provide a validation filter before the application."], "published": "2021-11-17T20:15:10.587", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["metabase"], "productName": ["metabase"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-w73v-6p7p-fpfr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/metabase/metabase/commit/042a36e49574c749f944e19cf80360fd3dc322f0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["analytics", "bi", "business-intelligence", "businessintelligence", "clojure", "dashboard", "data", "data-analysis", "data-visualization", "database", "metabase", "mysql", "postgres", "postgresql", "reporting", "slack", "sql-editor", "visualization"], "langs": {"Clojure": 21946134, "TypeScript": 14882824, "JavaScript": 6356087, "CSS": 224314, "MDX": 54756, "Shell": 35667, "Handlebars": 29885, "HTML": 5476, "Emacs Lisp": 5176, "Dockerfile": 5007, "Mustache": 2982}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10520629?v=4", "stargazers": 41485, "language": "Clojure"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Seals6/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/tahtaciburak/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/Henry4E36/Metabase-cve-2021-41277", "https://github.com/kap1ush0n/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/z3n70/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/kaizensecurity/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/Vulnmachines/Metabase_CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/TheLastVvV/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/zer0yu/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/chengling-ing/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/RubXkuB/PoC-Metabase-CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/Seals6/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/tahtaciburak/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/Henry4E36/Metabase-cve-2021-41277", "https://github.com/kap1ush0n/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/z3n70/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/kaizensecurity/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/Vulnmachines/Metabase_CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/TheLastVvV/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/zer0yu/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/chengling-ing/CVE-2021-41277", "https://github.com/RubXkuB/PoC-Metabase-CVE-2021-41277"]}
