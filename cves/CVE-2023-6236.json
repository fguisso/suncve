When an OIDC app that serves multiple tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user to log in again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration. The underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new \"provider-url\" option in addition to the \"realm\" option.\r\n\r\nEAP-7 does not provide the vulnerable provider-url configuration option in its OIDC implementation and is not affected by this flaw."], "published": "2024-04-10T01:15:17.383", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 9", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
