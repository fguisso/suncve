It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to modify and/or gain access to arbitrary files on a user's system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option."], "published": "2019-12-13T01:15:10.913", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["npm"], "productName": ["cli"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/npm/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-x8qc-rrcw-4r46"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/npm/cli/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "nodejs", "npm", "npm-cli", "package-manager", "tools"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 13524925, "Handlebars": 25834, "Shell": 10986, "PowerShell": 1526, "Batchfile": 1180}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6078720?v=4", "stargazers": 8794, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
