This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.36."], "published": "2025-03-01T09:15:09.517", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sminozzi"], "productName": ["Database Backup and check Tables Automated With Scheduler 2024"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
