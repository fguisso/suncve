Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up."], "published": "2021-09-30T15:15:07.730", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parse-community"], "productName": ["parse-server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-7pr3-p5fm-8r9x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/4ac4b7f71002ed4fbedbb901db1f6ed1e9ac5559"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["baas", "backend", "file-storage", "graphql", "graphql-api", "graphql-relay", "graphql-server", "hacktoberfest", "mbaas", "mongodb", "nodejs", "notifications", "object-storage", "parse-platform", "parse-server", "postgres", "relay", "rest-api"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 4405989, "HTML": 25832, "Shell": 7825, "Handlebars": 2113, "Dockerfile": 1211, "TypeScript": 899}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26932219?v=4", "stargazers": 21073, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
