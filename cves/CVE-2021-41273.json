Due to improperly configured CSRF protections on two routes, a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against the following endpoints: Sending a test email and Generating a node auto-deployment token. At no point would any data be exposed to the malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam to an administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token unexpectedly. This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is simply created unexpectedly in the system. This has been addressed in release `1.6.6`. Users may optionally manually apply the fixes released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems."], "published": "2021-11-17T20:15:10.400", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pterodactyl"], "productName": ["panel"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-wwgq-9jhf-qgw6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/bf9cbe2c6d5266c6914223e067c56175de7fc3a5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["docker", "free", "games", "golang", "laravel", "management-system", "mit", "opensource", "php", "react", "tailwindcss", "typescript"], "langs": {"PHP": 1658615, "TypeScript": 558694, "Blade": 313257, "CSS": 33788, "JavaScript": 28750, "Nix": 3968, "Dockerfile": 2022}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16179146?v=4", "stargazers": 7386, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
