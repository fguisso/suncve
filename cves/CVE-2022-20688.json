An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause Cisco Discovery Protocol to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition."], "published": "2022-12-12T09:15:12.347", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
