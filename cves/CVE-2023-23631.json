In versions priot to 1.5.2 trying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics and virtual memory leaks. If you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can then trigger a panic. This is caused by bogus fanout parameter in the HAMT directory nodes. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-02-09T21:15:11.513", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ipfs"], "productName": ["go-unixfsnode"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/security/advisories/GHSA-4gj3-6r43-3wfc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/commit/59050ea8bc458ae55246ae09243e6e165923e076", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/commit/91b3d39d33ef0cd2aff2c95d50b2329350944b68", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/commit/a4ed723727e0bdc2277158337c2fc0d82802d122"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 177430}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10536621?v=4", "stargazers": 13, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
