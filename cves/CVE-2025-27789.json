When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available."], "published": "2025-03-11T20:15:18.330", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["babel"], "productName": ["babel"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/babel/babel/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ast", "babel", "compiler", "es2015", "es6", "flavortown", "javascript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 3798415, "JavaScript": 1946775, "Shell": 31698, "Makefile": 4647, "HTML": 3371, "Batchfile": 43}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9637642?v=4", "stargazers": 43488, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
