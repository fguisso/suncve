This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with GiveWP Manager-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries within the Legacy View mode, that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."], "published": "2024-09-27T06:15:13.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["webdevmattcrom"], "productName": ["GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
