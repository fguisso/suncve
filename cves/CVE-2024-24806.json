The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-02-07T22:15:10.173", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["libuv"], "productName": ["libuv"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/libuv/libuv/security/advisories/GHSA-f74f-cvh7-c6q6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/0f2d7e784a256b54b2385043438848047bc2a629", "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/3530bcc30350d4a6ccf35d2f7b33e23292b9de70", "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/c858a147643de38a09dd4164758ae5b685f2b488", "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/e0327e1d508b8207c9150b6e582f0adf26213c39"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/security/advisories/GHSA-f74f-cvh7-c6q6", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asynchronous", "deep-io", "io", "networking", "unicorns", "unix", "velociraptors", "windows"], "langs": {"C": 3074444, "M4": 36963, "CMake": 28653, "Makefile": 21982, "Python": 2623, "Shell": 2489, "Batchfile": 1312}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4030929?v=4", "stargazers": 25046, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
