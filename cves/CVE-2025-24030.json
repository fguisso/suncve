A user with access to the Kubernetes cluster can use a path traversal attack to execute Envoy Admin interface commands on proxies managed by any version of Envoy Gateway prior to 1.2.6. The admin interface can be used to terminate the Envoy process and extract the Envoy configuration (possibly containing confidential data). Version 1.2.6 fixes the issue. As a workaround, the `EnvoyProxy` API can be used to apply a bootstrap config patch that restricts access strictly to the prometheus stats endpoint. Find below an example of such a bootstrap patch."], "published": "2025-01-23T04:15:07.100", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["envoyproxy"], "productName": ["gateway"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/security/advisories/GHSA-j777-63hf-hx76"], "commits": ["https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/commit/3eb3301ab3dbf12b201b47bdb6074d1233be07bd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api-gateway", "cncf", "envoy", "gateway-api", "go-control-plane", "hacktoberfest", "kubernetes"], "langs": {"Go": 3675101, "Makefile": 47269, "SCSS": 32885, "Smarty": 18696, "Shell": 17925, "HTML": 12073, "Lua": 11898, "Python": 11656, "Jsonnet": 5408, "Dockerfile": 779}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30125649?v=4", "stargazers": 1797, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
