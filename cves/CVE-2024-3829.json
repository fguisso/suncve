Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating snapshot files to include symlinks, leading to arbitrary file read by adding a symlink that points to a desired file on the filesystem and arbitrary file write by including a symlink and a payload file in the snapshot's directory structure. This vulnerability allows for the reading and writing of arbitrary files on the server, which could potentially lead to a full takeover of the system. The issue is fixed in version v1.9.0."], "published": "2024-06-03T10:15:14.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["qdrant"], "productName": ["qdrant/qdrant"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/commit/ee7a31ec3459a6a4219200234615c1817ab82260"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai-search", "ai-search-engine", "embeddings-similarity", "hnsw", "image-search", "knn-algorithm", "machine-learning", "mlops", "nearest-neighbor-search", "neural-network", "neural-search", "recommender-system", "search", "search-engine", "search-engines", "similarity-search", "vector-database", "vector-search", "vector-search-engine"], "langs": {"Rust": 8020765, "Python": 978227, "Shell": 95379, "C": 16959, "Dockerfile": 7599, "Nix": 6707, "JavaScript": 1502, "Mermaid": 970}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73504361?v=4", "stargazers": 22877, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
