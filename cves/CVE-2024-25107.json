On Special:WikiDiscover, the `Language::date` function is used when making the human-readable timestamp for inclusion on the wiki_creation column. This function uses interface messages to translate the names of months and days. It uses the `->text()` output mode, returning unescaped interface messages. Since the output is not escaped later, the unescaped interface message is included on the output, resulting in an XSS vulnerability. Exploiting this on-wiki requires the `(editinterface)` right. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `267e763a0`. Users are advised to update their installations. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-02-08T23:15:10.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["miraheze"], "productName": ["WikiDiscover"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/security/advisories/GHSA-cfcf-94jv-455f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/commit/267e763a0d7460f001693c42f67717a0fc3fd6bb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["mediawiki-extension"], "langs": {"PHP": 37532}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13278007?v=4", "stargazers": 4, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
