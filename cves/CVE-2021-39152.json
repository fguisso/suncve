In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream with a Java runtime version 14 to 8.

If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.18."], "published": "2021-08-23T19:15:13.247", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["x-stream"], "productName": ["xstream"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-xw4p-crpj-vjx2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-xw4p-crpj-vjx2", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["java", "xml", "xstream"], "langs": {"Java": 2852082, "HTML": 711607, "CSS": 7028, "Batchfile": 2073, "Shell": 1714, "XSLT": 1128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12127637?v=4", "stargazers": 752, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
