The vulnerability is due to improper resource management during CAPWAP message processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high volume of legitimate wireless management frames within a short time to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition for clients associated with the AP."], "published": "2019-10-16T19:15:14.050", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Aironet Access Point Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
