Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2025-02-12T19:15:21.717", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["advplyr"], "productName": ["audiobookshelf"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-pg8v-5jcv-wrvw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/bf8407274e3ee300af1927ee660d078a7a801e1c", "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/ec6537656925a43871b07cfee12c9f383844d224"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-pg8v-5jcv-wrvw", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["audiobook-manager", "audiobooks", "audiobookshelf", "podcasts", "self-hosted"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3095688, "Vue": 1470852, "CSS": 37022, "Shell": 6399, "Dockerfile": 1776, "HTML": 315}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67830747?v=4", "stargazers": 8275, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
