Versions prior to 2.0.3 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability when the sanitizer is used with a `contentEditable` element to set the elements `innerHTML` to a sanitized string produced by the package. If the code is particularly crafted to abuse the code beautifier, that runs AFTER sanitation. The issue is patched in version 2.0.3."], "published": "2025-03-14T19:15:48.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jitbit"], "productName": ["HtmlSanitizer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jitbit/HtmlSanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-vhv4-fh94-jm5x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jitbit/HtmlSanitizer/commit/af6d2a78877e7277cd01c825b7fb50edb5956963"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jitbit/HtmlSanitizer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["sanitize", "sanitize-html", "sanitizer"], "langs": {"HTML": 5189, "JavaScript": 4452}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2749700?v=4", "stargazers": 152, "language": "HTML"}}, "pocList": []}
