In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable."], "published": "2025-02-10T16:15:38.990", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenSC"], "productName": ["pam_pkcs11"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/security/advisories/GHSA-wvr3-c9x3-9mff"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/security/advisories/GHSA-wvr3-c9x3-9mff", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 593442, "M4": 114629, "Shell": 21209, "Makefile": 8119, "Lex": 2039, "sed": 58}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/895249?v=4", "stargazers": 74, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
