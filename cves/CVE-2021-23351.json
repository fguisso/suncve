The reader in this package is a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection until it finds a newline. Since no limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting with PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline) until the target stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources should be allowed to send proxy protocol headers."], "published": "2021-03-08T05:15:12.593", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["github.com/pires/go-proxyproto"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/commit/7f48261db810703d173f27f3309a808cc2b49b8b"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["golang", "haproxy", "proxy-protocol"], "langs": {"Go": 179905}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1752631?v=4", "stargazers": 522, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
