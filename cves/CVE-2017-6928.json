This check fails under certain conditions in which one module is trying to grant access to the file and another is trying to deny it, leading to an access bypass vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for unusual site configurations."], "published": "2018-03-01T23:29:00.357", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Drupal.org"], "productName": ["Drupal Core"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
