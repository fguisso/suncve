This allows local users who are not administrators to grant themselves the Full Control permission on Velociraptor's files. By modifying Velociraptor's files, local users can subvert the binary and cause the Velociraptor service to execute arbitrary code as the SYSTEM user, or to replace the Velociraptor binary completely.Â  This issue is fixed in version 0.73.3."], "published": "2024-11-07T11:15:03.973", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Rapid7"], "productName": ["Velociraptor"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
