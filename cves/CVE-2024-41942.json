Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0, if a user is granted the `admin:users` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user. The impact is relatively small in that `admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to trusted users.\nIn effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not intended. Note that the change here only prevents escalation to the built-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It does not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselves or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional. Versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0 fix this issue."], "published": "2024-08-08T15:15:17.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jupyterhub"], "productName": ["jupyterhub"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/security/advisories/GHSA-9x4q-3gxw-849f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/99e2720b0fc626cbeeca3c6337f917fdacfaa428", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/ff2db557a85b6980f90c3158634bf924063ab8ba"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ipython", "jupyter-notebook", "jupyterhub", "multi-user", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 1600578, "JavaScript": 119523, "HTML": 41567, "SCSS": 6099, "CSS": 4430, "Shell": 3105, "Mako": 494}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17927519?v=4", "stargazers": 7963, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
