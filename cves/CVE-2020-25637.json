This flaw affects the polkit access control driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."], "published": "2020-10-06T14:15:12.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["libvirt"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/brahmiboudjema/CVE-2020-25637-libvirt-double-free", "https://github.com/brahmiboudjema/CVE-2020-25637-libvirt-double-free"]}
