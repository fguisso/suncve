When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648."], "published": "2024-08-01T22:15:29.567", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vim"], "productName": ["vim"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-46pw-v7qw-xc2f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/b29f4abcd4b3382fa746edd1d0562b7b48c"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-46pw-v7qw-xc2f", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/vim/vim/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "cross-platform", "text-editor", "vim"], "langs": {"Vim Script": 19984759, "C": 14598137, "Roff": 576344, "Makefile": 500512, "C++": 247181, "NSIS": 191455, "M4": 160210, "Java": 85451, "Shell": 75449, "PostScript": 64070, "Module Management System": 56607, "Python": 51761, "XS": 51729, "Ruby": 40318, "JavaScript": 37774, "NewLisp": 37431, "Raku": 34258, "Emacs Lisp": 30304, "Perl": 29735, "SystemVerilog": 27883, "Smalltalk": 25762, "Awk": 19481, "Batchfile": 19178, "Objective-C": 13147, "DIGITAL Command Language": 10835, "HTML": 6885, "Prolog": 4336, "KRL": 4206, "MATLAB": 1970, "Thrift": 1670, "OpenEdge ABL": 1490, "sed": 826, "Tcl": 745, "Lua": 738, "TeX": 593, "BitBake": 388}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11618545?v=4", "stargazers": 37878, "language": "Vim Script"}}, "pocList": []}
