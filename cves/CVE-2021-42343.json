Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution."], "published": "2021-10-26T11:15:07.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dask/distributed/security/advisories/GHSA-hwqr-f3v9-hwxr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dask/distributed/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dask", "distributed-computing", "hacktoberfest", "pydata", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 4511105, "HTML": 18631, "Jinja": 17093, "JavaScript": 9337, "CSS": 4362, "Shell": 604}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17131925?v=4", "stargazers": 1622, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
