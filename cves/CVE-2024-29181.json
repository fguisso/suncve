Prior to version 4.19.1, a super admin can create a collection where an item in the collection has an association to another collection. When this happens, another user with Author Role can see the list of associated items they did not create. They should see nothing but their own items they created not all items ever created. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-content-manager to version 4.19.1 to receive a patch."], "published": "2024-06-12T15:15:50.873", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["strapi"], "productName": ["strapi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security/advisories/GHSA-6j89-frxc-q26m"], "commits": ["https://github.com/strapi/strapi/commit/e1dfd4d9f1cab25cf6da3614c1975e4e508e01c6"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security/advisories/GHSA-6j89-frxc-q26m", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "cms", "cms-framework", "content-management", "content-management-system", "customizable", "dashboard", "graphql", "hacktoberfest", "headless-cms", "jamstack", "javascript", "koa", "koa2", "mysql", "no-code", "nodejs", "rest", "strapi", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 9359998, "JavaScript": 1774835, "Handlebars": 6769, "Shell": 2341, "MDX": 1518, "HTML": 658}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19872173?v=4", "stargazers": 65999, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
