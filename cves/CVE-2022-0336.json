Some of these checks are able to be bypassed if an account modification re-adds an SPN that was previously present on that account, such as one added when a computer is joined to a domain. An attacker who has the ability to write to an account can exploit this to perform a denial-of-service attack by adding an SPN that matches an existing service. Additionally, an attacker who can intercept traffic can impersonate existing services, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity."], "published": "2022-08-29T15:15:09.250", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Samba"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/samba-team/samba/commit/1a5dc817c0c9379bbaab14c676681b42b0039a3c", "https://github.com/samba-team/samba/commit/c58ede44f382bd0125f761f0479c8d48156be400"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/samba-team/samba/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["samba"], "langs": {"C": 57821024, "Python": 13723264, "Shell": 2032694, "Perl": 995519, "Rust": 236526, "Yacc": 82469, "XSLT": 69367, "Lex": 20684, "Makefile": 18825, "Dockerfile": 12369, "TeX": 12122, "HTML": 4295, "RPC": 3570, "Batchfile": 2954, "BitBake": 2892, "sed": 2625, "Awk": 2592, "Roff": 2581, "M4": 1668, "PHP": 1060, "CSS": 873, "VBScript": 308}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13281359?v=4", "stargazers": 949, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
