In affected versions an attacker can access an Armeria server's local file system beyond its restricted directory by sending an HTTP request whose path contains `%2F` (encoded `/`), such as `/files/..%2Fsecrets.txt`, bypassing Armeria's path validation logic. Armeria 1.13.4 or above contains the hardened path validation logic that handles `%2F` properly. This vulnerability can be worked around by inserting a decorator that performs an additional validation on the request path."], "published": "2021-12-02T18:15:08.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["line"], "productName": ["armeria"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/line/armeria/security/advisories/GHSA-8fp4-rp6c-5gcv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/line/armeria/commit/e2697a575e9df6692b423e02d731f293c1313284"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/line/armeria/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["gateway", "grpc", "grpc-client", "grpc-server", "hacktoberfest", "http", "http-client", "http-server", "http2", "micro-framework", "microservices", "netty", "rpc", "rpc-client", "rpc-framework", "rpc-library", "rpc-server", "thrift", "thrift-client", "thrift-server"], "langs": {"Java": 21872949, "MDX": 1128941, "TypeScript": 278613, "Thrift": 257694, "Scala": 238820, "Kotlin": 156259, "Less": 35351, "JavaScript": 26455, "Shell": 2062, "HTML": 1222, "CSS": 820}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13128444?v=4", "stargazers": 4898, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
