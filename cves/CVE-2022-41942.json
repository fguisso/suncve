In versions prior to 4.1.0 a command Injection vulnerability existed in the gitserver service, present in all Sourcegraph deployments. This vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation on the host parameter of the `/list-gitolite` endpoint. It was possible to send a crafted request to gitserver that would execute commands inside the container. Successful exploitation requires the ability to send local requests to gitserver. The issue is patched in version 4.1.0."], "published": "2022-11-22T19:15:18.017", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sourcegraph"], "productName": ["sourcegraph"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm3-23mh-6xjp"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/", "info": {"exist": false, "topics": null, "langs": {}, "avatar": null, "stargazers": 0, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
