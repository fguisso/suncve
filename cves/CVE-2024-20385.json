An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using machine-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and Cisco NDO and then using a crafted certificate to impersonate the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to learn sensitive information during communications between these devices."], "published": "2024-10-02T17:15:15.110", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
