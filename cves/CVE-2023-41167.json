This is a react component to render data coming from Webiny Headless CMS and Webiny Form Builder. Webiny is an open-source serverless enterprise CMS. The @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer package depends on the editor.js rich text editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich text content from the editor.js into the database. When the @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer is used to render such content, it uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop, without applying HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor, who in this context would specifically be a content manager with access to the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined input. This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser when the main page or admin page loads."], "published": "2023-08-25T14:15:10.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/security/advisories/GHSA-3x59-vrmc-5mx6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aws", "aws-lambda", "cloud", "cms", "graphql", "headless", "headless-cms", "javascript", "lambda", "lambda-functions", "microservice", "nodejs", "react", "serverless", "serverless-applications", "serverless-architectures", "serverless-framework", "spa", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 19597782, "JavaScript": 3566759, "CSS": 34074, "SCSS": 33095, "HTML": 4054}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3808429?v=4", "stargazers": 7560, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
