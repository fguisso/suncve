Starting in the 2.36 branch and prior to versions 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, and 2.39.1.2, using object model traversal in the payload of a PATCH request, authenticated users with write access to an object may be able to modify related objects that they should not have access to. DHIS2 implementers should upgrade to a supported version of DHIS2 to receive a patch: 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, or 2.39.1.2. It is possible to work around this issue by blocking all PATCH requests on a reverse proxy, but this may cause some issues with the functionality of built-in applications using legacy PATCH requests."], "published": "2023-05-09T15:15:10.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dhis2"], "productName": ["dhis2-core"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/security/advisories/GHSA-pwvw-4m67-f4g2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "hibernate", "java", "maven", "spring", "spring-mvc"], "langs": {"Java": 38312953, "JavaScript": 758945, "CSS": 169636, "PLpgSQL": 75232, "HTML": 61589, "Groovy": 34085, "Shell": 17966, "XSLT": 6968, "SCSS": 4229, "Ruby": 1011, "Dockerfile": 107}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1089987?v=4", "stargazers": 298, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
