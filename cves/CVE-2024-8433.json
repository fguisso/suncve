Please note that this was partially fixed in 1.1.0 due to the missing authorization protection that was added."], "published": "2024-10-08T10:15:05.110", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["themehunk"], "productName": ["Easy Mega Menu Plugin for WordPress – ThemeHunk"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
