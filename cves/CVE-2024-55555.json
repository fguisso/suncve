This is exacerbated by .env files, available from the product's repository, that have default APP_KEY values. The route/{hash} route defined in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger remote command execution from arbitrary deserialization.) Therefore, an attacker in possession of the APP_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function."], "published": "2025-01-07T17:15:30.503", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/commit/d9302021472c3e7e23bac8c3d5fbec57a5f38f0c"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["einvoicing", "expenses", "flutter", "hacktoberfest", "invoice", "invoiceninja", "invoices", "javascript", "kanban", "laravel", "payments", "php", "projects", "quotes", "tasks", "time-tracker"], "langs": {"PHP": 32125452, "XSLT": 3712646, "Blade": 1353385, "HTML": 513165, "JavaScript": 9799, "TypeScript": 3531}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15712270?v=4", "stargazers": 8717, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
