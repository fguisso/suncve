If the protocol has been compiled using default settings, this will only grant the attacker access to allocated but unused memory. However, if it was configured using non-default settings, there is the possibility that exploiting this vulnerability could lead to system crashes and remote code execution."], "published": "2023-03-01T00:15:10.897", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Sub-IoT"], "productName": ["DASH 7 Alliance Protocol stack implementation"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Sub-IoT/Sub-IoT-Stack/security/advisories/GHSA-ggxh-88wc-c4fg"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Sub-IoT/Sub-IoT-Stack/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["communication-stack", "dash7", "embedded", "firmware", "iot"], "langs": {"C": 93658654, "HTML": 338507, "CMake": 248174, "Assembly": 106873, "Shell": 3610, "Dockerfile": 1185, "Python": 1012}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91058048?v=4", "stargazers": 152, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
