In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose."], "published": "2021-08-23T19:15:10.440", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["x-stream"], "productName": ["xstream"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-6wf9-jmg9-vxcc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-6wf9-jmg9-vxcc", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["java", "xml", "xstream"], "langs": {"Java": 2852082, "HTML": 711607, "CSS": 7028, "Batchfile": 2073, "Shell": 1714, "XSLT": 1128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12127637?v=4", "stargazers": 752, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
