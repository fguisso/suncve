In affected versions envoyâ€™s procedure for resetting a HTTP/2 stream has O(N^2) complexity, leading to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. Deployments are susceptible to Denial of Service when Envoy is configured with high limit on H/2 concurrent streams. An attacker wishing to exploit this vulnerability would require a client opening and closing a large number of H/2 streams. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to reduce time complexity of resetting HTTP/2 streams. As a workaround users may limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 dreams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 100."], "published": "2021-08-24T21:15:09.553", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["envoyproxy"], "productName": ["envoy"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-3xh3-33v5-chcc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cars", "cats", "cats-over-dogs", "cncf", "corgis", "more-cats", "nanoservices", "rocket-ships"], "langs": {"C++": 49350623, "Starlark": 3216959, "Java": 1325292, "Python": 604792, "Assembly": 327095, "Kotlin": 310645, "Swift": 250537, "Go": 247548, "Shell": 232235, "Rust": 139702, "C": 70169, "JavaScript": 66339, "Objective-C++": 55490, "Objective-C": 48840, "Jinja": 47798, "Smarty": 3528, "CSS": 2927, "HTML": 1522, "Emacs Lisp": 966, "Dockerfile": 960, "Thrift": 748, "PureBasic": 472, "Batchfile": 439, "Makefile": 303}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30125649?v=4", "stargazers": 25769, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
