The JSPUI controlled vocabulary servlet is vulnerable to an open redirect attack, where an attacker can craft a malicious URL that looks like a legitimate DSpace/repository URL. When that URL is clicked by the target, it redirects them to a site of the attacker's choice. This issue has been patched in versions 5.11 and 6.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability."], "published": "2022-08-01T21:15:13.423", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["DSpace"], "productName": ["DSpace"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-763j-q7wv-vf3m"], "commits": ["https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/5f72424a478f59061dcc516b866dcc687bc3f9de", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/f7758457b7ec3489d525e39aa753cc70809d9ad9"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-763j-q7wv-vf3m", "kw": ["steps:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dspace", "java", "open-access", "open-source", "repository", "rest-api"], "langs": {"Java": 24523354, "XSLT": 450529, "HTML": 64598, "Rich Text Format": 47367, "Shell": 10745, "Dockerfile": 8697, "Perl": 8695, "JavaScript": 6281, "Batchfile": 4417, "FreeMarker": 2995, "CSS": 2772, "PLpgSQL": 1032, "TeX": 748}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428620?v=4", "stargazers": 946, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
