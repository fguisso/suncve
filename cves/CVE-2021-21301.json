In Wire for iOS (iPhone and iPad) before version 3.75 there is a vulnerability where the video capture isn't stopped in a scenario where a user first has their camera enabled and then disables it. It's a privacy issue because video is streamed to the call when the user believes it is disabled. It impacts all users in video calls. This is fixed in version 3.75."], "published": "2021-02-11T18:15:16.910", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wireapp"], "productName": ["wire-ios"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-7fg4-x8vj-qvxf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/commit/7e3c30120066c9b10e50cc0d20012d0849c33a40"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["app", "audio", "communication", "encryption", "end-to-end-encryption", "instant-messaging", "ios", "ios-app", "messenger", "messenger-platform", "mobile", "mobile-app", "open-source", "otr", "privacy", "security", "swift", "video", "wire", "wire-ios"], "langs": {"Swift": 22339085, "Objective-C": 3202733, "Java": 743586, "Gherkin": 228701, "Groovy": 51059, "Ruby": 40217, "Shell": 21363, "C": 12796, "Python": 853}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16047324?v=4", "stargazers": 82, "language": "Swift"}}, "pocList": []}
