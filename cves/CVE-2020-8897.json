Due to the non-committing property of AES-GCM (and other AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM-SIV or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305) used by the SDKs to encrypt messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext which will decrypt to multiple different results, and becomes especially relevant in a multi-recipient setting. We recommend users update their SDK to 2.0.0 or later."], "published": "2020-11-16T12:15:14.557", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Amazon"], "productName": ["AWS SDK"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-wqgp-vphw-hphf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/google/security-research/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 3261224, "Python": 153144, "Shell": 123520, "Go": 122474, "TypeScript": 84926, "Makefile": 59334, "Assembly": 49813, "Java": 31234, "CSS": 23622, "CodeQL": 18092, "Dockerfile": 13547, "HTML": 6938, "C++": 6653, "JavaScript": 3944, "GDB": 811, "PHP": 556}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342004?v=4", "stargazers": 3851, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
