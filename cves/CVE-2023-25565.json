Prior to version 1.2.0, an incorrect free when decoding target information can trigger a denial of service. The error condition incorrectly assumes the `cb` and `sh` buffers contain a copy of the data that needs to be freed. However, that is not the case. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point. This will likely trigger an assertion failure in `free`, causing a denial-of-service. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0."], "published": "2023-02-14T18:15:13.263", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gssapi"], "productName": ["gss-ntlmssp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q7f-wqcg-mvfg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/c16100f60907a2de92bcb676f303b81facee0f64"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 476794, "M4": 9365, "Makefile": 6335, "Shell": 1817}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63316684?v=4", "stargazers": 31, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
