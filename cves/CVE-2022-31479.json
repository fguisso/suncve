This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.302 for the LP series and 1.296 for the EP series. An attacker with this level of access on the device can monitor all communications sent to and from this device, modify onboard relays, change configuration files, or cause the device to become unstable. The injected commands only get executed during start up or when unsafe calls regarding the hostname are used. This allows the attacker to gain remote access to the device and can make their persistence permanent by modifying the filesystem."], "published": "2022-06-06T17:15:10.933", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["LenelS2", "HID Mercury"], "productName": ["LNL-X2210", "LNL-X2220", "LNL-X3300", "LNL-X4420", "LNL-4420", "S2-LP-1501", "S2-LP-1502", "S2-LP-2500", "S2-LP-4502", "LP1501", "LP1502", "LP2500", "LP4502", "EP4502"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/realyme/CVE-2022-31479-test", "https://github.com/realyme/CVE-2022-31479-test"]}
