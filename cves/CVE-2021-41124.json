In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots)."], "published": "2021-10-05T21:15:09.590", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["scrapy-plugins"], "productName": ["scrapy-splash"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/security/advisories/GHSA-823f-cwm9-4g74"], "commits": ["https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/commit/2b253e57fe64ec575079c8cdc99fe2013502ea31"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["headless-browsers", "scrapy"], "langs": {"Python": 121087}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13627237?v=4", "stargazers": 3194, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
