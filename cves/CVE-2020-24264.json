Once such a container is spawned, it can be leveraged to break out of the container leading to complete Docker host machine takeover."], "published": "2021-03-16T15:15:12.607", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
