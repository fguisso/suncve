This can e.g., happen when pointing acc(2)\nto /sys/power/resume. At the point the where the write to this file\nhappens the calling task has already exited and called exit_fs(). A\nlookup will thus trigger a NULL-deref when accessing current->fs.\n\nReorganize the code so that the the final write happens from the\nworkqueue but with the caller's credentials. This preserves the\n(strange) permission model and has almost no regression risk.\n\nThis api should stop to exist though."], "published": "2025-03-12T10:15:16.960", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
