Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a `LookupResources` request with 1.22.0 is affected. For example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources instead, then some users that shouldn't have access may. Generally, `LookupResources` is not and should not be to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since its initial release. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.22.2. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions."], "published": "2023-06-26T20:15:10.507", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["authzed"], "productName": ["spicedb"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-m54h-5x5f-5m6r"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["abac", "acl", "ciam", "cloud-native", "database", "distributed-systems", "entitlements", "fga", "fine-grained-access-control", "grpc", "kubernetes", "latency", "permissions", "production", "rbac", "rebac", "scale", "security", "security-tools", "zanzibar"], "langs": {"Go": 4944305, "JavaScript": 16612, "HTML": 3663, "Dockerfile": 1496}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73313589?v=4", "stargazers": 5527, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
