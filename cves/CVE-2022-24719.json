Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2."], "published": "2022-03-01T21:15:07.923", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluture-js"], "productName": ["fluture-node"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/security/advisories/GHSA-32x6-qvw6-mxj4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/commit/0c99bc511533d48be17dc6bfe641f7d0aeb34d77", "https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/commit/125e4474f910c1507f8ec3232848626fbc0f55c4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["buffer", "events", "fluture", "http", "https", "nodejs", "request", "streams", "timers"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 54147, "Shell": 935}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24990356?v=4", "stargazers": 19, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
