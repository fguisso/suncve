The `instance_create()` D-Bus function can be called by locally logged-in users without authentication. This flaw allows a local non-privileged user to execute a D-Bus call with `script_pre` or `script_post` options that permit arbitrary scripts with their absolute paths to be passed. These user or attacker-controlled executable scripts or programs could then be executed by Tuned with root privileges that could allow attackers to local privilege escalation."], "published": "2024-11-26T16:15:17.093", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Fast Datapath for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Fast Datapath for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Fast Datapath for RHEL 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
