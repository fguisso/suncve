The vulnerabilities are due to improper boundary checks for certain user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the API subsystem of an affected system. When this request is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system (OS)."], "published": "2020-11-18T19:15:12.540", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Unified Computing System (Standalone) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
