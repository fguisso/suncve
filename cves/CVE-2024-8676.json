When it does that restoration, it attempts to restore the mounts from the restore archive instead of the pod request. As a result, the validations run on the pod spec, verifying that the pod has access to the mounts it specifies are not applicable to a restored container. This flaw allows a malicious user to trick CRI-O into restoring a pod that doesn't have access to host mounts. The user needs access to the kubelet or cri-o socket to call the restore endpoint and trigger the restore."], "published": "2024-11-26T20:15:34.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
