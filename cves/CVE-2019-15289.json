The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted traffic to the video service of an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the video service to crash, resulting in a DoS condition on an affected device."], "published": "2020-09-23T01:15:12.723", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco TelePresence TC Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
