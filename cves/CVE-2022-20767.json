The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the DNS reputation enforcement rule. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets through an affected device to force a buildup of UDP connections. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic that is going through the affected device to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.
