This issue arises because the same buffer is used to decode the paths for multiple requests simultaneously, leading to incorrect path information being processed. As a result, the server may attempt to access the wrong path, causing errors such as \"404 Not Found\" or other application failures. This flaw can potentially lead to a denial of service, as legitimate resources become inaccessible due to the path mix-up."], "published": "2024-06-20T15:15:50.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["EAP 8.0.1", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.1 for Spring Boot", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel for Spring Boot 3", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel - HawtIO", "Red Hat Build of Keycloak", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Fuse 7", "Red Hat Integration Camel K", "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "Red Hat Process Automation 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
