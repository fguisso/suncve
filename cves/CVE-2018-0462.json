The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-provided input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in with a highly privileged user account and performing a sequence of specific user management operations that interfere with the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to permanently degrade the functionality of the affected system."], "published": "2018-10-05T14:29:04.137", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
