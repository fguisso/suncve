A signature consisting only of zeroes is always considered valid, making it trivial to forge signatures. Requiring multiple signatures from different public keys does not mitigate the issue: `ecdsa_verify_list_legacy()` will accept an arbitrary number of such forged signatures. Both the `ecdsautil verify` CLI command and the libecdsautil library are affected. The issue has been fixed in ecdsautils 0.4.1. All older versions of ecdsautils (including versions before the split into a library and a CLI utility) are vulnerable."], "published": "2022-05-06T00:15:07.697", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["freifunk-gluon"], "productName": ["ecdsautils"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/ecdsautils/security/advisories/GHSA-qhcg-9ffp-78pw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/ecdsautils/commit/1d4b091abdf15ad7b2312535b5b95ad70f6dbd08", "https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/ecdsautils/commit/39b6d0a77414fd41614953a0e185c4eefa2f88ad"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/ecdsautils/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 59610, "CMake": 8186}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3431254?v=4", "stargazers": 13, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
