The location of `connect.exe`'s config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\\etc\\connectrc`. Since `C:\\etc` can be created by any authenticated user, this makes `connect.exe` susceptible to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders. Alternatively, watch out for malicious `<drive>:\\etc\\connectrc` files on multi-user machines."], "published": "2023-04-25T21:15:10.480", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["git-for-windows"], "productName": ["git"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"C": 12020956, "Shell": 8680483, "Perl": 1112312, "Tcl": 857873, "Python": 183463, "Makefile": 174034, "Meson": 120604, "C++": 116083, "JavaScript": 49713, "CMake": 48147, "M4": 38265, "Roff": 26859, "SmPL": 15676, "Go": 15064, "Batchfile": 11440, "CSS": 10664, "Rust": 6798, "Emacs Lisp": 660, "PowerShell": 478, "ReScript": 92}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4571183?v=4", "stargazers": 8618, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
