When that privileged process runs, it will follow the planted symlink and overwrite that sensitive file. To fix that, glog now causes the program to exit (with status code 2) when it finds that the configured log file already exists."], "published": "2025-01-28T02:15:28.927", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["github.com/golang/glog"], "productName": ["github.com/golang/glog"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
