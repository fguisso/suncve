This breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node in the tree, which led to issuance of CVE-2022-39299 as it is a potential issue for dependents. Update to @xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7, @xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4 (dist-tag latest) or @xmldom/xmldom@>=0.9.0-beta.4 (dist-tag next). As a workaround, please one of the following approaches depending on your use case: instead of searching for elements in the whole DOM, only search in the `documentElement`or reject a document with a document that has more then 1 `childNode`."], "published": "2022-11-02T17:15:17.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["xmldom"], "productName": ["xmldom"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/security/advisories/GHSA-crh6-fp67-6883"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dom", "hacktoberfest", "html", "javascript", "xml"], "langs": {"HTML": 621841, "JavaScript": 499110, "Handlebars": 799, "Shell": 472}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34722805?v=4", "stargazers": 390, "language": "HTML"}}, "pocList": []}
