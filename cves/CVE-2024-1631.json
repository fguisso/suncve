When no seed value is provided, it is expected that the library generates the secret key using secure randomness. However, a recent change broke this guarantee and uses an insecure seed for key pair generation. Since the private key of this identity (535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe) is compromised, one could lose funds associated with the principal on ledgers or lose access to a canister where this principal is the controller. \n"], "published": "2024-02-21T03:15:08.747", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Internet Computer"], "productName": ["agent-js"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/security/advisories/GHSA-c9vv-fhgv-cjc3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 809845, "JavaScript": 5694, "SCSS": 1455, "Motoko": 1140, "HTML": 330}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59101585?v=4", "stargazers": 164, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
