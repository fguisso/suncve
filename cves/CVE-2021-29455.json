Grassroot Platform before master deployment as of 2021-04-16 did not properly verify the signature of JSON Web Tokens when refreshing an existing JWT. This allows to forge a valid JWT. The problem has been patched in version 1.3.1 by deprecating the JWT refresh function, which was an overdue deprecation regardless (the \"refresh\" flow is no longer used)."], "published": "2021-04-19T19:15:17.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["grassrootza"], "productName": ["grassroot-platform"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-f65w-6xw8-6734"], "commits": ["https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/commit/a2e6e885f8183a066d938cf909fd813a7af7d67f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 3509956, "HTML": 29802, "ASP.NET": 15432, "Shell": 6612, "PLpgSQL": 4808, "CSS": 876, "Dockerfile": 827}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11898087?v=4", "stargazers": 12, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
