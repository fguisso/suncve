Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. Starting with version 19.7.0, matrix-js-sdk has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround."], "published": "2022-09-28T20:15:16.533", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-js-sdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-r48r-j8fx-mq2c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/a587d7c36026fe1fcf93dfff63588abee359be76"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "matrix", "matrix-chat", "matrix-sdk"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5464276, "Python": 25161, "JavaScript": 17587, "Shell": 521}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 1750, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
