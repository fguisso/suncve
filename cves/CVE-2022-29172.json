In versions before `11.33.0`, when the “additional signup fields” feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property). Verification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template. You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the “additional signup fields” feature in your application. Upgrade to version `11.33.0`."], "published": "2022-05-05T23:15:09.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["auth0"], "productName": ["lock"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/auth0/lock/security/advisories/GHSA-7ww6-75fj-jcj7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/auth0/lock/commit/79ae557d331274b114848150f19832ae341771b1"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/auth0/lock/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dx-sdk", "lock"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1184837, "Stylus": 200056, "HTML": 54999, "SCSS": 9814, "Makefile": 344}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2824157?v=4", "stargazers": 1131, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
