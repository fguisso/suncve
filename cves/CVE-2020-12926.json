This can leave the TPM in a state where confidential key material in the TPM may be able to be compromised.

This potential attack may be used to change confidential information, alter executables signed by key material in the TPM, or create a denial of service of the device."], "published": "2020-11-12T20:15:15.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["AMD's fTPM implementation"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
