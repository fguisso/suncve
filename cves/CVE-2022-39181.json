Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a\nvulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most\ncommon mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or emailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby\nan attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content\nback to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser. \n\n"], "published": "2022-11-17T23:15:19.187", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["GLPI"], "productName": ["Reports plugin for GLPI"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
