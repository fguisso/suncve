Affected versions do not correctly honor a `Deny` policy on ByPassGoverance. Ideally, minio should return \"Access Denied\" to all users attempting to DELETE a versionId with the special header `X-Amz-Bypass-Governance-Retention: true`. However, this was not honored instead the request will be honored and an object under governance would be incorrectly deleted. All users are advised to upgrade.
