A vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing API token authentication, which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request. Users who leverage API token authentication are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to 1.10.9 or to 1.11.2. This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who have configured API token authentication. An attacker could craft a request that is always allowed by the Dapr sidecar over HTTP, even if the `dapr-api-token` in the request is invalid or missing. The issue has been fixed in Dapr 1.10.9 or to 1.11.2. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"], "published": "2023-07-21T21:15:11.657", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dapr"], "productName": ["dapr"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dapr/dapr/security/advisories/GHSA-59m6-82qm-vqgj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dapr/dapr/commit/83ca1abb11ffe34211db55dcd36d96b94252827a"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/security/advisories/GHSA-59m6-82qm-vqgj", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["containers", "event-driven", "kubernetes", "microservice", "microservices", "pubsub", "serverless", "sidecar", "state-management"], "langs": {"Go": 8513933, "Shell": 77921, "Makefile": 75515, "JavaScript": 26814, "Bicep": 26690, "C#": 20676, "Java": 17757, "Python": 13029, "Dockerfile": 9034, "Mustache": 7525, "PHP": 2600, "Smarty": 1572, "Batchfile": 1187}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51932459?v=4", "stargazers": 24615, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
