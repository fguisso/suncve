Only deployments where LDAP servers are configured to allow unauthenticated authentication mechanism for anonymous authorization are affected. A fix has been implemented in version 8.1.0 that returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized response for any authentication attempts where the password field is empty. As a workaround LDAP administrators can disallow unauthenticated bind requests by clients."], "published": "2020-11-06T18:15:12.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["alerta"], "productName": ["alerta"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/alerta/alerta/security/advisories/GHSA-5hmm-x8q8-w5jh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/alerta/alerta/commit/2bfa31779a4c9df2fa68fa4d0c5c909698c5ef65"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/alerta/alerta/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["alerta", "api-server", "mongodb", "monitoring", "postgres"], "langs": {"Python": 1170293, "HTML": 4765, "Makefile": 2945, "JavaScript": 2833, "Dockerfile": 1386, "Shell": 34}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5067139?v=4", "stargazers": 2427, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
