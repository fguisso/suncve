Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, if `ds_is_in_list()` is used with an invalid IP address string (`NULL` is illegal input), OpenSIPS will attempt to print a string from a random address (stack garbage), which could lead to a crash. All users of `ds_is_in_list()` without the `$si` variable as 1st parameter could be affected by this vulnerability to a larger, lesser or no extent at all, depending if the data passed to the function is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address string or not. Fixes will are available starting with the 3.1.9 and 3.2.6 minor releases. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2023-03-15T23:15:09.807", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenSIPS"], "productName": ["opensips"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm5-6vhv-3ff3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/e2f13d374"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 17218284, "Makefile": 128744, "Yacc": 81144, "Perl": 72729, "Python": 64356, "C++": 62693, "Shell": 36120, "M4": 32463, "XS": 31933, "Lex": 31126, "PHP": 16028, "Roff": 10751, "Vim Script": 5424, "GDB": 2914, "CMake": 461}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3853758?v=4", "stargazers": 1336, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
