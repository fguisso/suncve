Script code and references to external websites can be injected to the names of PGP public keys. When requesting that key later on using a specific URL, such script code might get executed. In case of injecting external websites, users might get lured into a phishing scheme. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.)."], "published": "2016-12-15T06:59:24.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
