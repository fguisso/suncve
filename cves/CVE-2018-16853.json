With this advisory the Samba Team clarify that the MIT Kerberos build of the Samba AD DC is considered experimental. Therefore the Samba Team will not issue security patches for this configuration. Additionally, Samba 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 have been issued as security releases to prevent building of the AD DC with MIT Kerberos unless --with-experimental-mit-ad-dc is specified to the configure command."], "published": "2018-11-28T14:29:00.533", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["[UNKNOWN]"], "productName": ["samba"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
