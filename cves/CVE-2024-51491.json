Based on Notary Project specifications. The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.\nAfter retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2025-01-13T22:15:13.843", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["notaryproject"], "productName": ["notation-go"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/commit/3c3302258ad510fbca2f8a73731569d91f07d196"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 664308, "Makefile": 1305}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32203186?v=4", "stargazers": 42, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
