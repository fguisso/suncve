This is due to a lack of authorization checks on the multiple_roles_update function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'wpda_role[]' parameter during a profile update. This requires the 'Enable role management' setting to be enabled for the site."], "published": "2023-04-12T14:15:07.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["peterschulznl"], "productName": ["WP Data Access"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/thomas-osgood/cve-2023-1874", "https://github.com/thomas-osgood/cve-2023-1874"]}
