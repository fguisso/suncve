This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves."], "published": "2021-08-31T17:15:08.087", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["npm"], "productName": ["node-tar"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/npm/node-tar/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["npm-cli"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 271712, "TypeScript": 211914}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9287?v=4", "stargazers": 860, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
