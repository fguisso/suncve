In affected versions the ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line. Users are advised to upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may block all access to the following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to /admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/xmlui\", then you'd need to block access to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/jspui\", then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport. Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability."], "published": "2022-08-01T21:15:13.557", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["DSpace"], "productName": ["DSpace"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-8rmh-55h4-93h5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/56e76049185bbd87c994128a9d77735ad7af0199", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/7af52a0883a9dbc475cf3001f04ed11b24c8a4c0"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-8rmh-55h4-93h5", "kw": ["steps:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dspace", "java", "open-access", "open-source", "repository", "rest-api"], "langs": {"Java": 24523354, "XSLT": 450529, "HTML": 64598, "Rich Text Format": 47367, "Shell": 10745, "Dockerfile": 8697, "Perl": 8695, "JavaScript": 6281, "Batchfile": 4417, "FreeMarker": 2995, "CSS": 2772, "PLpgSQL": 1032, "TeX": 748}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428620?v=4", "stargazers": 946, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
