The vulnerability arises out of a failure to comprehensively sanitize the processing of .tar file (tape archives). The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of a user-supplied .tar file as it pertains to the names of the files contained within the archive. As a consequence, a remote attacker can specifically format these file names in a particular manner that will result in remotely executing a system command through Perl's qx operator with the privileges of the Email Security Gateway product. This issue was fixed as part of BNSF-36456 patch. This patch was automatically applied to all customer appliances."], "published": "2023-05-24T19:15:09.363", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Barracuda"], "productName": ["Barracuda Email Security Gateway"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/cfielding-r7/poc-cve-2023-2868", "https://github.com/cashapp323232/CVE-2023-2868CVE-2023-2868", "https://github.com/krmxd/CVE-2023-2868", "https://github.com/cfielding-r7/poc-cve-2023-2868", "https://github.com/cashapp323232/CVE-2023-2868CVE-2023-2868", "https://github.com/krmxd/CVE-2023-2868"]}
