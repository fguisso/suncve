The vulnerability is due to improper handling of email messages that contain large attachments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email message through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition due to high CPU utilization. This vulnerability may require manual intervention to recover the ESA."], "published": "2020-09-23T01:15:14.520", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
