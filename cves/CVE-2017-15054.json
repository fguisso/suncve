To exploit this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker has to tamper with parameters of a request to upload.files.php, in order to select the correct branch and be able to upload any arbitrary file. From there, it can simply access the file to execute code on the server."], "published": "2017-11-27T19:29:00.347", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/commit/9811c9d453da4bd1101ff7033250d1fbedf101fc"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["php"], "langs": {"PHP": 6473559, "CSS": 4733826, "JavaScript": 4626193, "SCSS": 248319, "Less": 238413, "HTML": 4914, "Shell": 2704, "Dockerfile": 2138}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1197546?v=4", "stargazers": 1713, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
