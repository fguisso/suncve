Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when GraphQL Subscriptions are enabled.  It can be triggered when **all of the following conditions are met**: 1. Running Apollo Router v1.28.0, v1.28.1 or v1.29.0 (\"impacted versions\"); **and** 2. The Supergraph schema provided to the Router (either via Apollo Uplink or explicitly via other configuration) **has a `subscription` type** with root-fields defined; **and** 3. The YAML configuration provided to the Router **has subscriptions enabled** (they are _disabled_ by default), either by setting `enabled: true` _or_ by setting a valid `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [subscriptions' documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup)); **and** 4. An [anonymous](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Anonymous-Operation-Definitions) (i.e., un-named) `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`) is received by the Router If **all four** of these criteria are met, the impacted versions will panic and terminate.  There is no data-privacy risk or sensitive-information exposure aspect to this vulnerability. This is fixed in Apollo Router v1.29.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Updating to v1.29.1 should be a clear and simple upgrade path for those running impacted versions.  However, if Subscriptions are **not** necessary for your Graph – but are enabled via configuration — then disabling subscriptions is another option to mitigate the risk."], "published": "2023-09-05T19:15:48.610", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["apollographql"], "productName": ["router"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/b295c103dd86c57c848397d32e8094edfa8502aa"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["apollo", "federated-graph", "federation", "gateway", "gateway-api", "graph-router", "graphql"], "langs": {"Rust": 10333953, "TLA": 23302, "Shell": 14640, "HTML": 4884, "TypeScript": 4820, "Smarty": 3754, "Handlebars": 1847, "Dockerfile": 537}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17189275?v=4", "stargazers": 860, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
