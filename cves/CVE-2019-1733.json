The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the NX-API Sandbox interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the NX-API Sandbox interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected NX-API Sandbox interface."], "published": "2019-05-15T17:29:01.907", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
