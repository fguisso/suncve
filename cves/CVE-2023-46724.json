Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages."], "published": "2023-11-01T20:15:08.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["squid-cache"], "productName": ["squid"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-73m6-jm96-c6r3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/b70f864940225dfe69f9f653f948e787f99c3810"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ecap", "ftp", "http", "https", "icap", "proxy"], "langs": {"C++": 7946772, "C": 709097, "M4": 223219, "Makefile": 141206, "Perl": 119339, "Shell": 98823, "Roff": 70681, "Awk": 7112, "HTML": 2381, "CSS": 1791, "sed": 311}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/363029?v=4", "stargazers": 2438, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
