When using the origin path as __proto__, the attribute of the object is accessed instead of a path. **Note:** This vulnerability derives from an incomplete fix in https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CACHEDPATHRELATIVE-72573"], "published": "2022-01-21T20:15:07.963", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["cached-path-relative"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/ashaffer/cached-path-relative/commit/40c73bf70c58add5aec7d11e4f36b93d144bb760"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/ashaffer/cached-path-relative/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1172, "Makefile": 200}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1871136?v=4", "stargazers": 5, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
