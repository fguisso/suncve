Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.17.0 and 1.12.3."], "published": "2024-09-10T19:15:22.030", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["SAML-Toolkits"], "productName": ["ruby-saml"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-jw9c-mfg7-9rx2", "https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-cvp8-5r8g-fhvq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/1ec5392bc506fe43a02dbb66b68741051c5ffeae", "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/4865d030cae9705ee5cdb12415c654c634093ae7"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 558976}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116213842?v=4", "stargazers": 944, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/synacktiv/CVE-2024-45409", "https://github.com/synacktiv/CVE-2024-45409"]}
