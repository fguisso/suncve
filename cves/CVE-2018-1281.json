In versions older than 1.0.0, however, the MXNet framework will listen on 0.0.0.0 rather than user specified DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI once a scheduler node is initialized. This exposes the instance running MXNet to any attackers reachable via the interface they didn't expect to be listening on. For example: If a user wants to run a clustered setup locally, they may specify to run on 127.0.0.1. But since MXNet will listen on 0.0.0.0, it makes the port accessible on all network interfaces."], "published": "2018-06-08T19:29:00.263", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache MXNet"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/dmlc/ps-lite/commit/4be817e8b03e7e92517e91f2dfcc50865e91c6ea"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/dmlc/ps-lite/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C++": 177228, "Python": 30902, "Makefile": 4345, "CMake": 4131, "Shell": 2726, "C": 1505}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11508361?v=4", "stargazers": 1544, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
