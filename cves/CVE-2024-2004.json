The below command would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext protocol which has been explicitly disabled.      curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se  The flaw is only present if the set of selected protocols disables the entire set of available protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and therefore unlikely to be encountered in real situations.
