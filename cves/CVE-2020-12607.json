When using the NIST P-256 curve in the ECDSA implementation, the point at infinity is mishandled. This means that for an extreme value in k and s^-1, the signature verification fails even if the signature is correct. This behavior is not solely a usability problem. There are some threat models where an attacker can benefit by successfully guessing users for whom signature verification will fail."], "published": "2020-06-02T21:15:10.607", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/commit/4a16daeaf139be20654ef58a9fe4c79dc030458c", "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/commit/e592f106edd5acf6dacedfab2ad16fe6c735c9d1", "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/commit/7b64e3efaa806b4daaf73bb5172af3581812f8de"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cryptography", "digital-signature", "ecdsa", "elliptic-curves", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 114703, "C": 15603}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7116785?v=4", "stargazers": 272, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
