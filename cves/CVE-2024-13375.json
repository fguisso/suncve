This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password through the adifier_recover() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account."], "published": "2025-01-18T09:15:07.120", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["spoonthemes"], "productName": ["Adifier System"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/McTavishSue/CVE-2024-13375", "https://github.com/McTavishSue/CVE-2024-13375"]}
