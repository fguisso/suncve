In case of (Netconf over) SSH this leads to stuck SSH sessions, so that when the connection-limit for SSH is reached new sessions can't be established anymore. A similar behavior will be seen for telnet etc.\n\nStuck mgd processes can be monitored by executing the following command:\n\nÂ  user@host> show system processes extensive | match mgd | match sbwait\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series:\nAll versions earlier than 20.4R3-S9;\n21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;\n21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5;\n22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;\n22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;\n22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2;\n22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R3;\n23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2."], "published": "2024-04-12T15:15:23.950", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
