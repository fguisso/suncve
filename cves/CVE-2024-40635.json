A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.0.4 where containers launched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images."], "published": "2025-03-17T22:15:13.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["containerd"], "productName": ["containerd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-265r-hfxg-fhmg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/05044ec0a9a75232cad458027ca83437aae3f4da", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/1a43cb6a1035441f9aca8f5666a9b3ef9e70ab20", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/cf158e884cfe4812a6c371b59e4ea9bc4c46e51a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "containerd", "containers", "cri", "docker", "hacktoberfest", "kubernetes", "oci"], "langs": {"Go": 5509619, "Shell": 110628, "Makefile": 26121, "PowerShell": 6191, "jq": 4089, "Dockerfile": 3995}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14037953?v=4", "stargazers": 18212, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
