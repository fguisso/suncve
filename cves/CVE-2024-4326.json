The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection of the `/apply_settings` and `/execute_code` endpoints. Attackers can bypass protections by setting the host to localhost, enabling code execution, and disabling code validation through the `/apply_settings` endpoint. Subsequently, arbitrary commands can be executed remotely via the `/execute_code` endpoint, exploiting the delay in settings enforcement. This issue was addressed in version 9.5."], "published": "2024-05-16T09:15:16.887", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms-webui"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/abb4c6d495a95a3ef5b114ffc57f85cd650b905e"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "llm", "text-generation"], "langs": {"CSS": 3034388, "Vue": 1267094, "Python": 366554, "JavaScript": 194610, "Shell": 41865, "Batchfile": 30713, "Inno Setup": 27460, "HTML": 24508, "Jupyter Notebook": 3623, "Dockerfile": 1060}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827993?v=4", "stargazers": 4600, "language": "CSS"}}, "pocList": []}
