This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. For the free version, this is limited to administrators. The pro version is also vulnerable and exploitable by administrators, but also offers the functionality to lower level users (as low as subscribers) if enabled."], "published": "2024-05-02T17:15:16.273", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["softaculous"], "productName": ["FileOrganizer – Manage WordPress and Website Files"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
