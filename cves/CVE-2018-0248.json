The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the device. This vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation for unexpected configuration options that the attacker could submit while accessing the GUI configuration menus. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the device and submitting crafted user input when using the administrative GUI configuration feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Software versions prior to 8.3.150.0, 8.5.140.0, 8.8.111.0 are affected by this vulnerability."], "published": "2019-04-17T22:29:00.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
