Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource as \"accessible\" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion. In `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion. Version 1.4.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions."], "published": "2022-01-11T22:15:07.727", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["authzed"], "productName": ["spicedb"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8f-8hjm-wm92"], "commits": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/15bba2e2d2a4bda336a37a7fe8ef8a35028cd970"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["abac", "acl", "ciam", "cloud-native", "database", "distributed-systems", "entitlements", "fga", "fine-grained-access-control", "grpc", "kubernetes", "latency", "permissions", "production", "rbac", "rebac", "scale", "security", "security-tools", "zanzibar"], "langs": {"Go": 4944305, "JavaScript": 16612, "HTML": 3663, "Dockerfile": 1496}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73313589?v=4", "stargazers": 5527, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
