Versions of Next.js between 10.0.0 and 11.0.0 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability. In order for an instance to be affected by the vulnerability, the `next.config.js` file must have `images.domains` array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other than default or the instance is deployed on Vercel, the instance is not affected by the vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in Next.js version 11.1.1."], "published": "2021-08-31T00:15:07.203", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vercel"], "productName": ["next.js"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9gr3-7897-pp7m"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog", "browser", "compiler", "components", "hybrid", "nextjs", "node", "react", "server-rendering", "ssg", "static", "static-site-generator", "universal", "vercel"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 29894335, "TypeScript": 12883869, "Rust": 7130536, "CSS": 477383, "MDX": 279532, "Shell": 9978, "SCSS": 8077, "Dockerfile": 4523, "HTML": 2644, "Batchfile": 579, "WebAssembly": 497, "Sass": 302, "Pug": 49}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14985020?v=4", "stargazers": 130849, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
