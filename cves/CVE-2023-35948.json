Versions prior to 0.16.0 contain an open redirect vulnerability in the \"Sign In with GitHub\" functionality of Novu's open-source repository. It could have allowed an attacker to force a victim into opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially log into the repository under the victim's account gaining full control of the account. This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-Source deployments if the user manually enabled the GitHub OAuth on their self-hosted instance of Novu. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.0 to receive a patch."], "published": "2023-07-06T15:15:15.903", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["novuhq"], "productName": ["novu"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/novuhq/novu/security/advisories/GHSA-xxv3-m43w-gv79"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/novuhq/novu/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["alternative", "communication", "email", "hacktoberfest", "inbox", "javascript", "nodejs", "notification-center", "notifications", "novu", "push-notifications", "react", "reactjs", "sms", "transactional", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 14896776, "JavaScript": 315438, "Python": 216296, "CSS": 40330, "Handlebars": 18479, "Shell": 15914, "Dockerfile": 14374, "HTML": 10727, "MDX": 6088, "EJS": 2409}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77433905?v=4", "stargazers": 36714, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
