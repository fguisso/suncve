When verifying W3C Format Verifiable Credentials using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs (LDP-VCs), the result of verifying the presentation `document.proof` was not factored into the final `verified` value (`true`/`false`) on the presentation record. The flaw enables holders of W3C Format Verifiable Credentials using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs (LDPs) to present incorrectly constructed proofs, and allows malicious verifiers to save and replay a presentation from such holders as their own. This vulnerability has been present since version 0.7.0 and fixed in version 0.10.5."], "published": "2024-01-11T06:15:44.067", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["hyperledger"], "productName": ["aries-cloudagent-python"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/security/advisories/GHSA-97x9-59rv-q5pm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/commit/0b01ffffc0789205ac990292f97238614c9fd293", "https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/commit/4c45244e2085aeff2f038dd771710e92d7682ff2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aca-py", "hyperledger-indy", "indy-catalyst", "trust-over-ip", "verifiable-credentials", "verifiable-organizations-network", "verifiable-origins", "von"], "langs": {"Python": 9156315, "Shell": 19664, "Smarty": 4998, "Dockerfile": 4601, "JavaScript": 69}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114502864?v=4", "stargazers": 437, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
