The vulnerability is due to improper input validation for certain fields of specific SSL/TLS messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed SSL/TLS message through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after it has reloaded."], "published": "2020-10-21T19:15:17.887", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
