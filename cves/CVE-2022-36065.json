With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build."], "published": "2022-09-06T21:15:08.760", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["growthbook"], "productName": ["growthbook"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/security/advisories/GHSA-j24q-55xh-wm4r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/commit/1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ab-testing", "abtest", "abtesting", "analytics", "bigquery", "clickhouse", "continuous-delivery", "data-analysis", "data-engineering", "data-science", "experimentation", "feature-flagging", "feature-flags", "mixpanel", "redshift", "remote-config", "snowflake", "split-testing", "statistics"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 8722385, "Python": 238783, "SCSS": 133092, "JavaScript": 28873, "Jinja": 15735, "Handlebars": 14785, "Dockerfile": 3790, "CSS": 1296, "Shell": 1192}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65404594?v=4", "stargazers": 6483, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
