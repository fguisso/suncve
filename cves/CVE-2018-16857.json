In these cases the manual testing done to confirm an organisation's password policies apply as expected may not have been re-done after the upgrade."], "published": "2018-11-28T14:29:00.610", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["[UNKNOWN]"], "productName": ["samba"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
