The vulnerability is due to improper resource usage control. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic to the management interface (mgmt0) of an affected device at very high rates. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause unexpected behaviors such as high CPU usage, process crashes, or even full system reboots of an affected device."], "published": "2020-02-26T17:15:13.657", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software 5.0(1a)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
