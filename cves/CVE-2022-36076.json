Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2."], "published": "2022-09-02T13:15:08.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["NodeBB"], "productName": ["NodeBB"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-xmgg-fx9p-prq6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["community", "forum", "javascript", "mongodb", "node", "nodebb", "nodejs", "postgresql", "redis", "socket-io", "websockets"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3908503, "Smarty": 503502, "SCSS": 35001, "HTML": 6457, "Shell": 5633, "Dockerfile": 4900, "CSS": 3261, "Batchfile": 42}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4449608?v=4", "stargazers": 14511, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
