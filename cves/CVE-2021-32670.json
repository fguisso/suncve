The `?_trace=1` debugging feature in Datasette does not correctly escape generated HTML, resulting in a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks) vulnerability. This vulnerability is particularly relevant if your Datasette installation includes authenticated features using plugins such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords) as an attacker could use the vulnerability to access protected data. Datasette 0.57 and 0.56.1 both include patches for this issue. If you run Datasette behind a proxy you can workaround this issue by rejecting any incoming requests with `?_trace=` or `&_trace=` in their query string parameters."], "published": "2021-06-07T22:15:07.650", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["simonw"], "productName": ["datasette"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-xw7c-jx9m-xh5g"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/simonw/datasette/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asgi", "automatic-api", "csv", "datasets", "datasette", "datasette-io", "docker", "json", "python", "sql", "sqlite"], "langs": {"Python": 1068299, "HTML": 81140, "JavaScript": 25119, "CSS": 17707, "Shell": 3952, "C": 1548, "Just": 1193, "Dockerfile": 553}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9599?v=4", "stargazers": 9930, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
