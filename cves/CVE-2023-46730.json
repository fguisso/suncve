In affected versions there is full Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /api/upload.php endpoint. The /api/upload.php endpoint does not filter URLs which allows a malicious user to cause the server to make resource requests to untrusted domains. Note that protocols like file:// can also be used to access the server disk. The request result (on success) can then be retrieved using /api/download.php. This issue has been addressed in versions 6.8.15, 6.7.54, and 6.6.177. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-11-07T18:15:08.973", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Intermesh"], "productName": ["groupoffice"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-vw6c-h82w-mvfv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/commit/99205535e8cec6592fd7f1469837926f27c72d50"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-vw6c-h82w-mvfv", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["address-book", "calendar", "collaboration", "crm", "email", "file-sharing", "groupware"], "langs": {"PHP": 9093991, "JavaScript": 5101620, "SCSS": 226169, "TypeScript": 213095, "CSS": 57062, "HTML": 9326, "Shell": 8638, "Smarty": 6349, "Hack": 125, "Makefile": 30}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4598828?v=4", "stargazers": 217, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
