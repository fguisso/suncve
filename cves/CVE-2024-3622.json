It uses a default secret, which is stored in plain-text format in one of the configuration template files. This issue may lead to all instances of Quay deployed using mirror-registry to have the same secret key. This flaw allows a malicious actor to craft session cookies and as a consequence, it may lead to gaining access to the affected Quay instance."], "published": "2024-04-25T18:15:09.747", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
