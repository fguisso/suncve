The installer sets too relaxed permissions on /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/* core program files. By injecting a payload into one of those files, it will run with the same privileges as the Wowza server, root. For example, /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/tune.sh could be replaced with a Trojan horse. This issue was resolved in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5."], "published": "2020-01-29T16:15:11.990", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
