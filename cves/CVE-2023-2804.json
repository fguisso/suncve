The vulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for which the range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range, hence, an attacker could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting to decompress such image using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault or buffer overflows, causing an application to crash."], "published": "2023-05-25T22:15:09.443", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["libjpeg-turbo"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/9f756bc67a84d4566bf74a0c2432aa55da404021"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 3388993, "Assembly": 1683277, "HTML": 528105, "Java": 321248, "CMake": 160300, "C++": 48455, "Shell": 33744, "CSS": 22360, "JavaScript": 19458}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13406820?v=4", "stargazers": 3904, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
