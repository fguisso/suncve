This can be leveraged to gain access to higher-privilege endpoints, e.g. if you get a user with admin privileges to run the code, you can potentially elevate all users and grant them admin privileges or access protected content. Versions 14.3.1 and 15.0.0 contain a patch. As a workaround, ensure that access to the Dictionary section is only granted to trusted users."], "published": "2024-10-22T16:15:07.500", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["umbraco"], "productName": ["Umbraco-CMS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-c5g6-6xf7-qxp3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asp-net-core", "cms", "csharp", "dotnet-core", "hacktoberfest", "umbraco", "umbraco-cms"], "langs": {"C#": 19789884, "TypeScript": 11686920, "JavaScript": 103162, "HTML": 62862, "CSS": 20178, "MDX": 12163, "Dockerfile": 2714, "Shell": 1652, "TSQL": 159}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1419552?v=4", "stargazers": 4807, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
