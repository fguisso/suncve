The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The attacker would also have to have access to the internal VLAN where CPS is deployed. The vulnerability is due to incorrect permissions of certain system files and not sufficiently protecting sensitive data that is at rest. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using certain tools available on the internal network interface to request and view system files. An exploit could allow the attacker to find out sensitive information about the application.
