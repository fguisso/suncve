The vulnerability is due to overly permissive file permissions of specific system files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device, creating a crafted command string, and writing this crafted string to a specific file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root on an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials for the device."], "published": "2019-05-03T17:29:00.737", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches ACI Mode "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
