Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text."], "published": "2021-06-28T20:15:07.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PrismJS"], "productName": ["prism"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1059890, "HTML": 235863, "CSS": 50253, "C": 543, "Lua": 422, "C++": 306, "Shell": 244, "Awk": 106}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11140484?v=4", "stargazers": 12532, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
