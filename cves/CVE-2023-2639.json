If successfully exploited, this would allow a threat actor to receive information including whether FactoryTalk Policy Manager is installed and potentially the entire security policy. \n\n\n"], "published": "2023-06-13T21:15:10.043", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Rockwell Automation"], "productName": ["FactoryTalk System Services"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
