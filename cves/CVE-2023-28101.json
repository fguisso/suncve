In versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4, if an attacker publishes a Flatpak app with elevated permissions, they can hide those permissions from users of the `flatpak(1)` command-line interface by setting other permissions to crafted values that contain non-printable control characters such as `ESC`. A fix is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, use a GUI like GNOME Software rather than the command-line interface, or only install apps whose maintainers you trust."], "published": "2023-03-16T16:15:12.650", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flatpak"], "productName": ["flatpak"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-h43h-fwqx-mpp8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/409e34187de2b2b2c4ef34c79f417be698830f6c", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6cac99dafe6003c8a4bd5666341c217876536869", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/7fe63f2e8f1fd2dafc31d45154cf0b191ebec66c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 4873996, "Shell": 253943, "Python": 95324, "Meson": 63126, "Yacc": 46057, "Makefile": 1402, "M4": 1366}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19473042?v=4", "stargazers": 4416, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
