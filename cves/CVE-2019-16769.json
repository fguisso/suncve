It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions. If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability."], "published": "2019-12-05T19:15:15.180", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["yahoo"], "productName": ["serialize-javascript"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript/security/advisories/GHSA-h9rv-jmmf-4pgx"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "json", "serialize", "web"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 34563}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16574?v=4", "stargazers": 2848, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
