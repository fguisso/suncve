If a system is specially configured to allow unprivileged users to run sudo apport-cli, less is configured as the pager, and the terminal size can be set: a local attacker can escalate privilege. It is extremely unlikely that a system administrator would configure sudo to allow unprivileged users to perform this class of exploit."], "published": "2023-04-13T23:15:07.180", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Canonical Ltd."], "productName": ["Apport"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/canonical/apport/commit/e5f78cc89f1f5888b6a56b785dddcb0364c48ecb"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/canonical/apport/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 1590050, "Shell": 11371, "Java": 3342, "Perl": 1975, "CMake": 485}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53057619?v=4", "stargazers": 24, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/diego-tella/CVE-2023-1326-PoC", "https://github.com/Pol-Ruiz/CVE-2023-1326", "https://github.com/n3rdh4x0r/CVE-2023-1326", "https://github.com/cve-2024/CVE-2023-1326-PoC", "https://github.com/diego-tella/CVE-2023-1326-PoC", "https://github.com/Pol-Ruiz/CVE-2023-1326", "https://github.com/n3rdh4x0r/CVE-2023-1326", "https://github.com/cve-2024/CVE-2023-1326-PoC"]}
