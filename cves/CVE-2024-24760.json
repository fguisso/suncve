A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-01c. This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow` and the output interface is `br-mailcow`."], "published": "2024-02-02T16:15:56.163", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mailcow"], "productName": ["mailcow-dockerized"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-gmpj-5xcm-xxx6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/commit/087481ac12bfa5dd715f3630f0b1697be94f7e88"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["acme", "clamav", "docker", "docker-compose", "dovecot", "groupware", "hacktoberfest", "imap", "mail", "mailcow", "mailserver", "olefy", "postfix", "rspamd", "servercow", "smtp", "sogo"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1412773, "PHP": 1224124, "Twig": 632398, "CSS": 353044, "Shell": 306299, "Python": 116967, "Lua": 37207, "Dockerfile": 21259, "Jinja": 15863, "Perl": 5763, "HTML": 5479, "Smarty": 5136, "Ruby": 943, "C++": 891, "BitBake": 732, "Sieve": 296}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23747925?v=4", "stargazers": 9997, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/killerbees19/CVE-2024-24760", "https://github.com/killerbees19/CVE-2024-24760"]}
