Insufficient escaping in markdown “code highlighting” in the wire-webapp resulted in the possibility of injecting and executing arbitrary HTML code and thus also JavaScript. If a user receives and views such a malicious message, arbitrary code is injected and executed in the context of the victim. This allows the attacker to fully control the user account. Wire-desktop clients that are connected to a vulnerable wire-webapp version are also vulnerable to this attack. The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp 2022-03-30-production.0 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552 or wire-server 2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0), so that their applications are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ### Patches * The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp **2022-03-30-production.0** and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. * On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag **2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552** or wire-server **2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0)**, so that their applications are no longer affected. ### Workarounds * No workarounds known ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory feel free to email us at [vulnerability-report@wire.com](mailto:vulnerability-report@wire.com) ### Credits We thank [Posix](https://twitter.com/po6ix) for reporting this vulnerability"], "published": "2022-04-20T18:15:10.937", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wireapp"], "productName": ["wire-webapp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/security/advisories/GHSA-5568-rfh8-vmhq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/commit/d14455252a949dc83f36d45e2babbdd9328af2a4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["end-to-end-encryption", "hacktober", "hacktoberfest", "javascript", "knockout", "libsodium", "messenger", "reactjs", "typescript", "webapp", "wire"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 6346212, "Less": 315246, "JavaScript": 237022, "Shell": 16243, "HTML": 13071, "EJS": 10888, "CSS": 4737, "GLSL": 1710, "Mustache": 815, "Dockerfile": 320, "Procfile": 23}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16047324?v=4", "stargazers": 1156, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
