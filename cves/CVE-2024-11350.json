This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the adforest_reset_password() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account."], "published": "2025-01-08T09:15:06.460", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["scriptsbundle"], "productName": ["AdForest"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
