Prior to 3.16.0, by sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN, it is possible in some circumstances to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability of a site. It is possible to craft a request, such as https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json which will be rendered as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query string when determining whether to cache a route, then this JSON response could be served to future visitors to the site. An attacker can perform this attack to a vulnerable site in order to make a site unavailable indefinitely. It is also possible in the case where the cache will be reset to make a small script to send a request each X seconds (=caching duration) so that the cache is permanently poisoned making the site completely unavailable. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.16.0."], "published": "2025-03-19T19:15:47.257", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nuxt"], "productName": ["nuxt"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/security/advisories/GHSA-jvhm-gjrh-3h93"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["csr", "framework", "full-stack", "hacktoberfest", "hybrid", "node", "nuxt", "server-rendering", "ssg", "ssr", "static-site-generator", "universal", "vue"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1499322, "HTML": 27148, "JavaScript": 19878, "Vue": 8990, "Shell": 2611, "Dockerfile": 468}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23360933?v=4", "stargazers": 56703, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
