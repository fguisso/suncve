Prior to 0.8.0, the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However, the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox, multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0."], "published": "2024-05-08T15:15:11.310", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["hoppscotch"], "productName": ["hoppscotch"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/security/advisories/GHSA-qmmm-73r2-f8xr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/commit/22c6eabd133195d22874250a5ae40cb26b851b01"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/security/advisories/GHSA-qmmm-73r2-f8xr", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "api-client", "api-rest", "api-testing", "developer-tools", "graphql", "hacktoberfest", "http", "http-client", "pwa", "rest", "rest-api", "spa", "testing", "testing-tools", "tools", "vue", "vuejs", "websocket"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 3189550, "Vue": 1722336, "Rust": 316217, "JavaScript": 107177, "SCSS": 38418, "Handlebars": 24416, "Nix": 13010, "Dockerfile": 9772, "HTML": 3184, "Svelte": 1717, "CSS": 1547, "Shell": 1341}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56705483?v=4", "stargazers": 70834, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
