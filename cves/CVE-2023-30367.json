This allows attackers to access contents of configuration files in plain text through a memory dump and thus compromise user credentials when no custom password encryption key has been set. This also bypasses the connection configuration file encryption setting by dumping already decrypted configurations from memory."], "published": "2023-07-26T21:15:09.980", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/S1lkys/CVE-2023-30367-mRemoteNG-password-dumper", "https://github.com/S1lkys/CVE-2023-30367-mRemoteNG-password-dumper"]}
