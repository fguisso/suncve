When teler requests messages from the event stream on the `/events` endpoint, the log data displayed on the dashboard are not sanitized. This only affects authenticated users and can only be exploited based on detected threats if the log contains a DOM scripting payload. This vulnerability has been fixed on version `v2.0.0-rc.4`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2022-12-06T18:15:09.997", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kitabisa"], "productName": ["teler"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kitabisa/teler/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7p-8q82-878q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/kitabisa/teler/commit/20f59eda2420ac64e29f199a61230a0abc875e8e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kitabisa/teler/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["analyze-logs", "go", "golang", "ids", "intrusion", "intrusion-detection", "intrusion-detection-system", "iocs", "log", "log-analyzer", "logs", "threat", "threat-analyzer", "threat-hunting", "threat-intelligence", "threat-rules"], "langs": {"Go": 51013, "CSS": 29525, "JavaScript": 6694, "HTML": 5262, "Makefile": 2074, "Dockerfile": 471}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143272869?v=4", "stargazers": 3048, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
