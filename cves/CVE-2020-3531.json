The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly authenticate REST API calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) token and then using the token with REST API requests. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the back-end database of the affected device and read, alter, or drop information."], "published": "2020-11-18T19:15:12.773", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
