In affected versions a malicious message can crash CloudCore by triggering a nil-pointer dereference in the UDS Server. Since the UDS Server only communicates with the CSI Driver on the cloud side, the attack is limited to the local host network. As such, an attacker would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud. Additionally it will be affected only when users turn on the unixsocket switch in the config file cloudcore.yaml. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should sisable the unixsocket switch of CloudHub in the config file cloudcore.yaml."], "published": "2022-06-27T20:15:08.710", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kubeedge"], "productName": ["kubeedge"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-8f4f-v9x5-cg6j"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-native", "cncf", "container", "device-management", "docker", "edge-computing", "golang", "iot", "kubernetes", "mosquitto", "mqtt"], "langs": {"Go": 3878482, "Shell": 200453, "Makefile": 14265, "Dockerfile": 9882, "Mustache": 1288}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41812520?v=4", "stargazers": 6996, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
