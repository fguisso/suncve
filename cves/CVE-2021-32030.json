This relates to handle_request in router/httpd/httpd.c and auth_check in web_hook.o. An attacker-supplied value of '\\0' matches the device's default value of '\\0' in some situations. Note: All versions of Lyra Mini and earlier which are unsupported (End-of-Life, EOL) are also affected by this vulnerability, Consumers can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling the remote access features from WAN."], "published": "2021-05-06T15:15:07.973", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
