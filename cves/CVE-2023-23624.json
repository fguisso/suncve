Prior to version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, someone can use the `exclude_tag param` to filter out topics and deduce which ones were using a specific hidden tag. This affects any Discourse site using hidden tags in public categories. This issue is patched in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, secure any categories that are using hidden tags, change any existing hidden tags to not include private data, or remove any hidden tags currently in use."], "published": "2023-01-28T00:15:09.470", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["discourse"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-qgj5-g5vf-fm7q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/f55e0fe7910149c431861c18ce407d1be0d6091a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["discourse", "ember", "forum", "javascript", "postgresql", "rails", "ruby"], "langs": {"Ruby": 20745200, "JavaScript": 11121408, "HTML": 1462583, "SCSS": 999222, "Handlebars": 128056, "Mustache": 32177, "Shell": 12314, "CSS": 2564}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 43644, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
