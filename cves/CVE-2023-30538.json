Due to the improper sanitization of SVG files, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the usersâ€™ browsers by uploading a crafted SVG file. This issue is patched in the latest stable and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade there are two possible workarounds: enable CDN handing of uploads (and ensure the CDN sanitizes SVG files) or disable SVG file uploads by ensuring that the `authorized extensions` site setting does not include `svg` (or reset that setting to the default, by default Discourse doesn't enable SVG uploads by users).
