Multiple MSI's get executed out of a standard-user writable directory. Through a race condition and OpLock manipulation, these files can be overwritten by a standard user. They then get executed by the elevated installer. This gives a standard user full SYSTEM code execution (elevation of privileges)."], "published": "2023-04-04T15:15:08.717", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
