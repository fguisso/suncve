This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads."], "published": "2024-04-04T14:15:10.330", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Telecommunications Update Service", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
