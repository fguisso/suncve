Prior to `puma` version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work correctly. The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage. This problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11. This problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2. Upgrading to a patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the vulnerability."], "published": "2022-02-11T22:15:07.817", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["puma"], "productName": ["puma"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-rmj8-8hhh-gv5h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/b70f451fe8abc0cff192c065d549778452e155bb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/puma/puma/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["multithreading", "rack", "ruby", "server"], "langs": {"Ruby": 744971, "C": 59303, "Java": 43602, "Ragel": 9223, "Shell": 9208, "PowerShell": 3326, "Dockerfile": 1455, "Lua": 127, "Batchfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1264292?v=4", "stargazers": 7745, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
