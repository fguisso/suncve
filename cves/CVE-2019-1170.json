An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use the sandbox escape to elevate privileges on an affected system.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system, and then run a specially crafted application to take control over the affected system.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by preventing sandboxed processes from creating reparse points targeting inaccessible files.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:16.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
