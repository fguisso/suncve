To be vulnerable to the bypass, the application must use toolkit version <=1.1.1, use ZipSecurity as a guard against path traversal, and have an exploit path. Although the control still protects attackers from escaping the application path into higher level directories (e.g., /etc/), it will allow \"escaping\" into sibling paths. For example, if your running path is /my/app/path you an attacker could navigate into /my/app/path-something-else. This vulnerability is patched in 1.1.2.\n\n"], "published": "2024-02-01T19:15:08.360", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pixee"], "productName": ["java-security-toolkit"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/security/advisories/GHSA-qh4g-4m4w-jgv2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/commit/b885b03c9cfae53d62d239037f9654d973dd54d9"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/security/advisories/GHSA-qh4g-4m4w-jgv2", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 149653}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101823672?v=4", "stargazers": 20, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
