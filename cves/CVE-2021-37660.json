In affected versions an attacker can cause a floating point exception by calling inplace operations with crafted arguments that would result in a division by 0. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/inplace_ops.cc#L283) has a logic error: it should skip processing if `x` and `v` are empty but the code uses `||` instead of `&&`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit e86605c0a336c088b638da02135ea6f9f6753618. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.
