This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution."], "published": "2024-03-07T06:15:50.630", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wpeverest"], "productName": ["User Registration – Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
