An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-11-18T16:15:07.367", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Unity Connection", "Cisco Unified Communications Manager", "Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service", "Cisco Unified Communications Manager / Cisco Unity Connection"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
