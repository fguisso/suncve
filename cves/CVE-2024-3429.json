This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reading when the application is running on Windows. The issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, enabling attackers to bypass the path traversal protection mechanisms by crafting malicious input. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure, and potentially a denial of service (DoS) condition by including numerous large or resource-intensive files. This vulnerability affects the latest version prior to 9.6."], "published": "2024-06-06T19:16:02.103", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/commit/f4424cfc3d6dfb3ad5ac17dd46801efe784933e9"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 1449900, "Shell": 30804, "Batchfile": 16275, "HTML": 6350, "Jupyter Notebook": 4229, "C++": 3433, "Dockerfile": 957, "Makefile": 294}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827993?v=4", "stargazers": 288, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
