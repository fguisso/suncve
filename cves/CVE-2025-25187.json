This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally, Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2025-02-07T23:15:15.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["laurent22"], "productName": ["joplin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-9gfv-q6wj-fr3c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/360ece6f8873ef81afbfb98b25faad696ffccdb6"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-9gfv-q6wj-fr3c", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android", "dropbox", "electron", "enex-files", "evernote", "javascript", "joplin", "nextcloud", "nodejs", "note-taking", "onedrive", "react-native", "synchronisation", "web-clipper", "webdav"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 8753011, "JavaScript": 2397835, "Rust": 425623, "HTML": 238245, "CSS": 134921, "Java": 126765, "Mustache": 75164, "Objective-C": 47291, "Handlebars": 31635, "Shell": 30055, "SCSS": 29088, "C++": 23817, "Kotlin": 15719, "Ruby": 4892, "Objective-C++": 3082, "CMake": 2456, "MDX": 1722, "Starlark": 1318, "C": 940, "Swift": 370, "Batchfile": 138}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1285584?v=4", "stargazers": 48595, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
