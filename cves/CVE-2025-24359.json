Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue."], "published": "2025-01-24T17:15:16.197", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["lmfit"], "productName": ["asteval"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/security/advisories/GHSA-3wwr-3g9f-9gc7"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/security/advisories/GHSA-3wwr-3g9f-9gc7", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ast", "eval", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 118613}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6190878?v=4", "stargazers": 190, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
