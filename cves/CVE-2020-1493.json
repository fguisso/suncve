This vulnerability could potentially allow users to share attached files such that they are accessible by anonymous users where they should be restricted to specific users.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to attach a file as a link to an email. The email could then be shared with individuals that should not have access to the files, ignoring the default organizational setting.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Outlook handles file attachment links.\n"], "published": "2020-08-17T19:15:16.210", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Microsoft Office 2019", "Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise", "Microsoft Outlook 2016", "Microsoft Outlook 2013 Service Pack 1", "Microsoft Outlook 2010 Service Pack 2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/0neb1n/CVE-2020-1493", "https://github.com/0neb1n/CVE-2020-1493"]}
