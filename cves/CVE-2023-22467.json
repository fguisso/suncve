On the 1.x branch prior to 1.38.1, the 2.x branch prior to 2.5.2, and the 3.x branch on 3.2.1, Luxon's `DateTime.fromRFC2822() has quadratic (N^2) complexity on some specific inputs. This causes a noticeable slowdown for inputs with lengths above 10k characters. Users providing untrusted data to this method are therefore vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. This issue also appears in Moment as CVE-2022-31129. Versions 1.38.1, 2.5.2, and 3.2.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, limit the length of the input."], "published": "2023-01-04T22:15:09.357", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["moment"], "productName": ["luxon"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/moment/luxon/security/advisories/GHSA-3xq5-wjfh-ppjc", "https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/moment/luxon/commit/5ab3bf64a10da929a437629cdb2f059bb83212bf"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/moment/luxon/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dates", "datetime", "intl", "times", "timezones"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 639393}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129662?v=4", "stargazers": 15807, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
