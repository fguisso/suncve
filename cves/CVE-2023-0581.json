This is due to the plugin checking if an IP had been blocklist via client-side scripts rather than server-side. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any login restrictions that may prevent a brute force attack."], "published": "2023-01-30T15:15:09.823", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["LCWeb"], "productName": ["PrivateContent"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
