In Fleet before version 3.7.0 a malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of service. This is possible only while a live query is currently ongoing. We believe the impact of this vulnerability to be low given the requirement that the actor has a valid node key. There is no information disclosure, privilege escalation, or code execution. The issue is fixed in Fleet 3.7.0."], "published": "2021-02-10T20:15:15.353", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fleetdm"], "productName": ["fleet"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-xwh8-9p3f-3x45"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/commit/f68f4238e83b45b2164e4ed05df14af0f06eaf40"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["device-management", "employee-experience", "endpoint-ops", "endpoint-security", "gitops", "mdm-api", "open-source", "osquery", "security-analytics", "vulnerability-management"], "langs": {"Go": 18256000, "JavaScript": 5465328, "TypeScript": 4471751, "Augeas": 703542, "SCSS": 353318, "EJS": 346613, "Shell": 205350, "HCL": 142498, "Less": 75399, "HTML": 62408, "PowerShell": 57307, "Ruby": 42872, "Makefile": 38069, "Open Policy Agent": 29875, "Perl": 24185, "Python": 20720, "Dockerfile": 9430, "Roff": 5414, "PHP": 3891, "Smarty": 3636, "CSS": 3483, "Puppet": 2310, "Jinja": 94}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70264713?v=4", "stargazers": 4446, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
