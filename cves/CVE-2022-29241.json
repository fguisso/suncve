Prior to version 1.17.1, if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir` that contains the starting user's home directory, then the underlying REST API can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time by guessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requires an authenticated user session, this URL can be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issue is patched in version 1.17.1."], "published": "2022-06-14T21:15:15.900", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jupyter-server"], "productName": ["jupyter_server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-q874-g24w-4q9g"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["jupyter", "server"], "langs": {"Python": 1079157, "HTML": 10136, "CSS": 1414, "JavaScript": 528}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71116660?v=4", "stargazers": 512, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
