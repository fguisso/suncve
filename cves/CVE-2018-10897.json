If an attacker controls a repository, they may be able to copy files outside of the destination directory on the targeted system via path traversal. If reposync is running with heightened privileges on a targeted system, this flaw could potentially result in system compromise via the overwriting of critical system files. Version 1.1.31 and older are believed to be affected."], "published": "2018-08-01T17:29:00.457", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["The RPM Project"], "productName": ["yum-utils:"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum-utils/commit/6a8de061f8fdc885e74ebe8c94625bf53643b71c", "https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum-utils/commit/7554c0133eb830a71dc01846037cc047d0acbc2c"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum-utils/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 562746, "Shell": 17845, "Perl": 8640, "Makefile": 6567}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8504469?v=4", "stargazers": 36, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
