This issue occurs when the parseProxyProtocolV1 method processes multiple requests on the same HTTP connection. As a result, different requests may share the same StringBuilder instance, potentially leading to information leakage between requests or responses. In some cases, a value from a previous request or response may be erroneously reused, which could lead to unintended data exposure. This issue primarily results in errors and connection termination but creates a risk of data leakage in multi-request environments."], "published": "2024-08-21T14:15:09.500", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["HawtIO 4.0.0 for Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel 3.20.7 for Spring Boot", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.2 for Spring Boot", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 for RHEL 9", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel for Spring Boot 3", "Red Hat Build of Keycloak", "Red Hat build of Quarkus", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Fuse 7", "Red Hat Integration Camel K", "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack", "Red Hat Process Automation 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
