The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root cause is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT record : the \"bytes_in_use\" field should be less than the \"bytes_allocated\" field. When it is not, the parsing of the records proceeds into the wild."], "published": "2021-09-07T14:15:11.567", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g/security/advisories/GHSA-q759-8j5v-q5jp"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 3420303, "Roff": 122460, "C++": 110758, "M4": 20636, "Makefile": 11984, "Shell": 866}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/699213?v=4", "stargazers": 1116, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
