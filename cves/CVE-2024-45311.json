As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`, or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical."], "published": "2024-09-02T18:15:37.373", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["quinn-rs"], "productName": ["quinn"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/security/advisories/GHSA-vr26-jcq5-fjj8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/commit/e01609ccd8738bd438d86fa7185a0f85598cb58f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "protocol", "quic", "rust"], "langs": {"Rust": 1358216}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72762072?v=4", "stargazers": 4163, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
