Prior to version 16.0.2, users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a shard containing `/` characters from VTAdmin such that from that point on, anyone who tries to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive an error. Attempting to view the keyspace(s) will also no longer work. Creating a shard using `vtctldclient` does not have the same problem because the CLI validates the input correctly. Version 16.0.2, corresponding to version 0.16.2 of the `go` module, contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Always use `vtctldclient` to create shards, instead of using VTAdmin; disable creating shards from VTAdmin using RBAC; and/or delete the topology record for the offending shard using the client for your topology server."], "published": "2023-05-11T20:15:09.403", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vitessio"], "productName": ["vitess"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/security/advisories/GHSA-pqj7-jx24-wj7w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commit/9dcbd7de3180f47e94f54989fb5c66daea00c920"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "database-cluster", "kubernetes", "mysql", "shard", "vitess"], "langs": {"Go": 36636951, "Java": 945768, "TypeScript": 762878, "Yacc": 200725, "Shell": 144547, "Smarty": 42259, "SCSS": 42141, "Assembly": 29554, "Dockerfile": 23233, "Makefile": 16745, "CSS": 10774, "JavaScript": 4145, "Perl": 3161, "Python": 1955, "HCL": 959, "HTML": 807}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33043890?v=4", "stargazers": 19376, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
