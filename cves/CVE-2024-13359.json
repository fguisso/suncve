This may make it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Please note that by default the plugin is only vulnerable to a double extension file upload attack, unless an administrators leaves the accepted file extensions field blank which can make .php file uploads possible. Please note 1.12.2 was mistakenly marked as patched while 1.12.1 was marked as vulnerable for a short period of time, this is not the case and 1.12.1 is fully patched."], "published": "2025-03-08T10:15:09.977", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tychesoftwares"], "productName": ["Product Input Fields for WooCommerce"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
