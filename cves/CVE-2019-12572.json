On startup, the PIA Windows service (pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library from %PROGRAMFILES%\\Private Internet Access\\libeay32.dll. This library attempts to load the C:\\etc\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file which does not exist. By default on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under C:\\. A low privileged user can create a C:\\etc\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts."], "published": "2019-06-21T18:15:09.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
