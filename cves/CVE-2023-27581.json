Starting in version 4.0.0` and prior to version 4.4.1, this action uses the `github.head_ref` parameter in an insecure way. This vulnerability can be triggered by any user on GitHub on any workflow using the action on pull requests. They just need to create a pull request with a branch name, which can contain the attack payload. This can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners and to exfiltrate any secrets one uses in the CI pipeline. A patched action is available in version 4.4.1. No workaround is available."], "published": "2023-03-13T21:15:14.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rlespinasse"], "productName": ["github-slug-action"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/security/advisories/GHSA-6q4m-7476-932w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/commit/102b1a064a9b145e56556e22b18b19c624538d94"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["continuous-delivery", "continuous-deployment", "continuous-integration", "github-actions", "hacktoberfest", "short", "slug", "workflows"], "langs": {"Shell": 1511}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280212?v=4", "stargazers": 271, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
