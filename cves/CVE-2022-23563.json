In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible."], "published": "2022-02-04T23:15:13.897", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tensorflow"], "productName": ["tensorflow"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-wc4g-r73w-x8mm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["deep-learning", "deep-neural-networks", "distributed", "machine-learning", "ml", "neural-network", "python", "tensorflow"], "langs": {"C++": 102396758, "Python": 45815380, "MLIR": 11057504, "HTML": 7662661, "Starlark": 7506655, "Go": 2173562, "C": 1354810, "Java": 1178817, "Jupyter Notebook": 805762, "Shell": 705966, "Objective-C++": 279654, "Objective-C": 169317, "CMake": 148615, "Smarty": 139464, "Swift": 81659, "Dockerfile": 38776, "C#": 13585, "Batchfile": 12126, "Ruby": 8898, "Perl": 7536, "Linker Script": 5261, "Roff": 5034, "Cython": 3899, "Makefile": 2845, "CSS": 2761, "Vim Snippet": 58}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15658638?v=4", "stargazers": 189260, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
