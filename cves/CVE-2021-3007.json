NOTE: the laminas-http vendor considers this a \"vulnerability in the PHP language itself\" but has added certain type checking as a way to prevent exploitation in (unrecommended) use cases where attacker-supplied data can be deserialized."], "published": "2021-01-04T03:15:13.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Vulnmachines/ZF3_CVE-2021-3007", "https://github.com/Vulnmachines/ZF3_CVE-2021-3007"]}
