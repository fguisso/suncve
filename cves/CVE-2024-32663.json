Prior to 7.0.5 and 6.0.19, a small amount of HTTP/2 traffic can lead to Suricata using a large amount of memory. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.5 and 6.0.19. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser and reducing `app-layer.protocols.http2.max-table-size` value (default is 65536)."], "published": "2024-05-07T15:15:08.713", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OISF"], "productName": ["suricata"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxm-qw9v-266r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/08d93f7c3762781b743f88f9fdc4389eb9c3eb64", "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/c0af92295e833d1db29b184d63cd3b829451d7fd", "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/d24b37a103c04bb2667e449e080ba4c8e56bb019", "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/e68ec4b227d19498f364a41eb25d3182f0383ca5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cybersecurity", "ids", "intrusion-detection-system", "intrusion-prevention-system", "ips", "network-monitor", "network-monitoring", "nsm", "security", "suricata", "threat-hunting"], "langs": {"C": 14194190, "Rust": 4392327, "M4": 113614, "Python": 77086, "Makefile": 47797, "Shell": 45734, "Raku": 38775, "Perl": 25948, "PHP": 7792, "SmPL": 5503, "Lua": 1583, "Dockerfile": 1106}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2188963?v=4", "stargazers": 5133, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
