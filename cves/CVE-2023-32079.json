A Mass assignment vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 that allows a non-admin user to escalate privileges to those of an admin user. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server."], "published": "2023-08-24T23:15:08.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gravitl"], "productName": ["netmaker"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/security/advisories/GHSA-826j-8wp2-4x6q"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud", "devsecops", "k8s", "kubernetes", "mesh", "mesh-network", "network", "networking", "overlay-network", "security", "self-hosted", "virtual-network", "virtual-networking", "vpn", "vpn-server", "wg-quick", "wireguard", "wireguard-ui", "wireguard-vpn", "zero-trust"], "langs": {"Go": 1128285, "Shell": 83940, "Dockerfile": 501}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81370672?v=4", "stargazers": 10014, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
