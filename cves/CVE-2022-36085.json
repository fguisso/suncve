The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe — and as such rejected — by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn’t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`. Multiple conditions need to be met in order to create an adverse effect. Version 0.43.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function and use the `capabilities` feature instead."], "published": "2022-09-08T14:15:08.340", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["open-policy-agent"], "productName": ["opa"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/security/advisories/GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/25a597bc3f4985162e7f65f9c36599f4f8f55823", "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/3e8c754ed007b22393cf65e48751ad9f6457fee8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["authorization", "cloud-native", "compliance", "declarative", "doge", "json", "lolcat", "opa", "open-policy-agent", "policy"], "langs": {"Go": 8359317, "C": 934778, "C++": 709198, "Open Policy Agent": 42476, "Makefile": 22524, "Shell": 18937, "JavaScript": 14203, "Python": 5616, "Dockerfile": 2601}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16468693?v=4", "stargazers": 10105, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
