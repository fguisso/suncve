A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Markdown rendering functionality of versions 3.18.1 and prior of the VNote note-taking application. This vulnerability allows the injection and execution of arbitrary JavaScript code through which remote code execution can be achieved. A patch for this issue is available at commit f1af78573a0ef51d6ef6a0bc4080cddc8f30a545. Other mitigation strategies include implementing rigorous input sanitization for all Markdown content and utilizing a secure Markdown parser that appropriately escapes or strips potentially dangerous content."], "published": "2024-07-24T17:15:11.310", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vnotex"], "productName": ["vnote"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/security/advisories/GHSA-w655-h68w-vxxc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/commit/f1af78573a0ef51d6ef6a0bc4080cddc8f30a545"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/security/advisories/GHSA-w655-h68w-vxxc", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["editor", "markdown", "mathjax", "note", "note-taking", "uml", "vim", "vnote"], "langs": {"C++": 2288788, "JavaScript": 1425195, "CSS": 205346, "CMake": 29329, "HTML": 27928, "Rich Text Format": 18666, "Python": 1610}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48284031?v=4", "stargazers": 12218, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/sh3bu/CVE-2024-41662", "https://github.com/sh3bu/CVE-2024-41662"]}
