The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system."], "published": "2024-09-26T22:15:04.063", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenPrinting"], "productName": ["libcupsfilters"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5", "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8", "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47", "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 1206467, "C++": 307383, "M4": 50504, "Shell": 7034, "Makefile": 4079}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20563597?v=4", "stargazers": 2, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/mutkus/CVE-2024-47076", "https://github.com/mutkus/CVE-2024-47076"]}
