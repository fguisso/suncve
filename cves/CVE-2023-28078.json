A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to information disclosure and a possible Denial of Service when a huge number of requests are sent to the switch. This is a high severity vulnerability as it allows an attacker to view sensitive data. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n"], "published": "2024-02-15T13:15:44.607", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Dell"], "productName": ["Dell SmartFabric OS10"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
