NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying \"It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report.\""], "published": "2003-12-31T05:00:00.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
