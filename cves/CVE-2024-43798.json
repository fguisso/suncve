The Chisel server doesn't ever read the documented `AUTH` environment variable used to set credentials, which allows any unauthenticated user to connect, even if credentials were set. Anyone running the Chisel server that is using the `AUTH` environment variable to specify credentials to authenticate against is affected by this vulnerability. Chisel is often used to provide an entrypoint to a private network, which means services that are gated by Chisel may be affected. Additionally, Chisel is often used for exposing services to the internet. An attacker could MITM requests by connecting to a Chisel server and requesting to forward traffic from a remote port. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.10.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-08-26T23:15:04.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jpillora"], "productName": ["chisel"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/security/advisories/GHSA-38jh-8h67-m7mj"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/security/advisories/GHSA-38jh-8h67-m7mj", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["golang", "http", "tcp", "tunnel"], "langs": {"Go": 115190, "Makefile": 1716}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633843?v=4", "stargazers": 14349, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
