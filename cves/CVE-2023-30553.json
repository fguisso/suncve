The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to multiple SQL injections in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value and the `full_sql` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed to the methods that follow in given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are `execute_check` in `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` `query` method, `execute_check` in `sql/engines/goinception.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py` `query` method, `execute_check` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which passes unsafe user input into the `object_name_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py` which in turn is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-102`."], "published": "2023-04-19T00:15:09.450", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["hhyo"], "productName": ["Archery"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-hvcq-r2r2-34ch"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["archery", "binlog2sql", "clickhouse", "data-masking", "database-schema", "ddl", "dml", "gh-ost", "inception", "mysql", "oracle", "sql-audit", "sql-query"], "langs": {"Python": 2528286, "Shell": 10307, "Mustache": 2102, "Dockerfile": 873}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8842982?v=4", "stargazers": 6286, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
