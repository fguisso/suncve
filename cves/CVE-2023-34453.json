Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error.\n\nThe function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nThe same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-06-15T17:15:09.790", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["xerial"], "productName": ["snappy-java"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-pqr6-cmr2-h8hf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/820e2e074c58748b41dbd547f4edba9e108ad905"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-pqr6-cmr2-h8hf", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 319032, "C++": 227887, "Shell": 94403, "Makefile": 9706, "Scala": 6548, "C": 5658, "CSS": 1554, "CMake": 525}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57538?v=4", "stargazers": 1053, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
