This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourseâ€™s default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in version 1.0.1 of the Discourse Calendar plugin. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks."], "published": "2022-06-14T20:15:07.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["discourse-calendar"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/security/advisories/GHSA-c783-x9vm-xxp5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/commit/2719b9e81994e961bf8c4e12b4556dc9777dd62f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["discourse", "discourse-plugin"], "langs": {"Ruby": 341863, "JavaScript": 227561, "SCSS": 29620, "Handlebars": 16475}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 66, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
