A vulnerability has been identified in Redlib where an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DOS) condition by submitting a specially crafted base2048-encoded DEFLATE decompression bomb to the restore_preferences form. This leads to excessive memory consumption and potential system instability, which can be exploited to disrupt Redlib instances. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.36.0."], "published": "2025-03-20T19:15:38.383", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["redlib-org"], "productName": ["redlib"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/security/advisories/GHSA-g8vq-v3mg-7mrg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/commit/15147cea8e42f6569a11603d661d71122f6a02dc", "https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/commit/2e95e1fc6e2064ccfae87964b4860bda55eddb9a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["privacy", "privacy-friendly-alternatives", "privacy-frontend", "rust"], "langs": {"Rust": 215333, "HTML": 63399, "CSS": 41923, "JavaScript": 8014, "Shell": 6022, "Dockerfile": 3317, "Nix": 1762, "Python": 850}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154758588?v=4", "stargazers": 1871, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
