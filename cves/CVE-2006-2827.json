CVE has not been able to investigate this issue further, although the researcher sometimes makes inaccurate claims."], "published": "2006-06-05T17:02:00.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
