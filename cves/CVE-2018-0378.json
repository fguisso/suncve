The vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against PTP frame flood attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large streams of malicious IPv4 or IPv6 PTP traffic to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition, impacting the traffic passing through the device."], "published": "2018-10-17T21:49:52.787", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 6000 Series "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
