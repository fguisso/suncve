Views that allow the user to control the default (not found) value of the `t` and `translate` helpers could be susceptible to XSS attacks. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a missing translation key named html or ending in _html, the default string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped. This is patched in versions 6.0.3.3 and 5.2.4.4. A workaround without upgrading is proposed in the source advisory."], "published": "2020-09-11T16:15:12.287", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rails"], "productName": ["actionview"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-cfjv-5498-mph5"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rails/rails/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activejob", "activerecord", "framework", "html", "mvc", "rails", "ruby"], "langs": {"Ruby": 17256286, "JavaScript": 228123, "HTML": 196993, "SCSS": 50596, "CSS": 46738, "Dockerfile": 2019, "Shell": 810}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4223?v=4", "stargazers": 56700, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/glasses618/CVE-2020-15169", "https://github.com/glasses618/CVE-2020-15169"]}
