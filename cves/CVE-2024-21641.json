Prior to version 1.8.5, the Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. As a workaround, some extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe."], "published": "2024-01-05T21:15:43.337", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flarum"], "productName": ["framework"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-733r-8xcp-w9mr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/flarum/flarum-core/commit/ee8b3b4ad1413a2b0971fdd9e40f812d2a3a9d3a", "https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/7d70328471cf3091d92d95c382d277aec7996176"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/flarum/framework/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["community", "flarum", "forum", "hacktoberfest", "javascript", "laravel", "php"], "langs": {"PHP": 2445956, "TypeScript": 1049067, "JavaScript": 318555, "Less": 177481, "Blade": 33637, "Hack": 5737, "Shell": 525}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5549034?v=4", "stargazers": 6528, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
