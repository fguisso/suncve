If a victim saves a local recording to an SMB location and later opens it using a link from Zoomâ€™s web portal, an attacker positioned on an adjacent network to the victim client could set up a malicious SMB server to respond to client requests, causing the client to execute attacker controlled executables. This could result in an attacker gaining access to a user's device and data, and remote code execution."], "published": "2023-03-27T21:15:12.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Zoom Video Communications Inc"], "productName": ["Zoom (for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows)", "Zoom Rooms (for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows)", "Zoom VDI for Windows"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
