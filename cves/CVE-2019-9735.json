By setting a destination port in a security group rule along with a protocol that doesn't support that option (for example, VRRP), an authenticated user may block further application of security group rules for instances from any project/tenant on the compute hosts to which it's applied. (Only deployments using the iptables security group driver are affected.)"], "published": "2019-03-13T02:29:00.277", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
