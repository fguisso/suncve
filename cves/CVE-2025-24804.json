According to Apple's documentation for bundle ID's, it must contain only alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, and 0–9), hyphens (-), and periods (.). However, an attacker can manually modify this value in the `Info.plist` file and add special characters to the `<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>` value. When the application parses the wrong characters in the bundle ID, it encounters an error. As a result, it will not display content and will throw a 500 error instead. The only way to make the pages work again is to manually remove the malicious application from the system. This issue has been addressed in version 4.3.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2025-02-05T19:15:46.350", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MobSF"], "productName": ["Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-jrm8-xgf3-fwqr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/05206e72cae35b311615a70e51e1a946955c5e83"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android-security", "api-testing", "apk", "cwe", "devsecops", "dynamic-analysis", "ios-security", "malware-analysis", "mastg", "masvs", "mobile-security", "mobsf", "mstg", "owasp", "rest", "runtime-security", "static-analysis", "web-security", "windows-mobile-security"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1582153, "Python": 1357612, "HTML": 1073644, "CSS": 148866, "Shell": 11552, "Batchfile": 4318, "PowerShell": 3089, "Dockerfile": 2909}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25052637?v=4", "stargazers": 18357, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
