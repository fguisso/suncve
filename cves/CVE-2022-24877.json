Path Traversal in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml` allows an attacker to expose sensitive data from the controllerâ€™s pod filesystem and possibly privilege escalation in multi-tenancy deployments. Workarounds include automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0."], "published": "2022-05-06T01:15:09.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluxcd"], "productName": ["flux2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["continuous-delivery", "gitops", "gitops-toolkit", "helm", "kubernetes", "kustomize"], "langs": {"Go": 1070721, "HCL": 9334, "Shell": 7615, "Makefile": 4535, "Dockerfile": 504}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52158677?v=4", "stargazers": 6964, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
