Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization in inference.py. `model_file` in inference.py as well as `model_file` in tts.py take user-supplied input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass that value to the `change_choices` and later to `get_speakers_id` function, which loads that model with `torch.load` in inference.py (line 326 in 3.2.8-bugfix), which is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The issue can lead to remote code execution. A patch is available on the `main` branch of the repository."], "published": "2025-03-19T21:15:40.117", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["IAHispano"], "productName": ["Applio"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/commit/eb21d9dd349a6ae1a28c440b30d306eafba65097"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "applio", "pytorch", "rvc", "speech", "speech-to-speech", "text-to-speech", "tts", "vc", "vits", "voice", "voice-clone", "voice-cloning", "voice-conversion"], "langs": {"Python": 609840, "Jupyter Notebook": 55361, "JavaScript": 7651, "Shell": 7169, "Batchfile": 4888, "Dockerfile": 1029, "Makefile": 507}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133545040?v=4", "stargazers": 2241, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
