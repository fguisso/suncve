This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isnâ€™t as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\""], "published": "2023-03-24T23:15:06.710", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
