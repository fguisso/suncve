This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."], "published": "2024-07-23T02:15:02.610", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ckp267"], "productName": ["MaxiBlocks: 2200+ Patterns, 190 Pages, 14.2K Icons & 100 Styles"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
