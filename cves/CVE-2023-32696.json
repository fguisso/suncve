Prior to versions 2.9.9 and 2.10.1, the `ckan` user (equivalent to www-data) owned code and configuration files in the docker container and the `ckan` user had the permissions to use sudo. These issues allowed for code execution or privilege escalation if an arbitrary file write bug was available. Versions 2.9.9, 2.9.9-dev, 2.10.1, and 2.10.1-dev contain a patch.\n\n\n\n"], "published": "2023-05-30T19:15:10.023", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ckan"], "productName": ["ckan-docker-base"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base/security/advisories/GHSA-c74x-xfvr-x5wg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base/commit/5483c46ce9b518a4e1b626ef7032cce2c1d75c7d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ckan", "ckanext", "docker"], "langs": {"Shell": 31007, "Python": 25695, "Dockerfile": 24528, "Roff": 6356, "Makefile": 572}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630326?v=4", "stargazers": 24, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
