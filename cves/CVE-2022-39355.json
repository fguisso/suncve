On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts."], "published": "2022-10-26T20:15:10.660", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["discourse-patreon"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/security/advisories/GHSA-fvj9-f67v-qpr4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/commit/846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["discourse", "discourse-plugin", "patreon"], "langs": {"Ruby": 48212, "JavaScript": 7855, "Handlebars": 4261, "SCSS": 565}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 44, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
