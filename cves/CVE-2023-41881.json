When a collaboration is deleted, the linked resources (such as tasks from that collaboration) should be deleted. This is partly to manage data properly, but also to prevent a potential (but unlikely) side-effect that affects versions prior to 4.0.0, where if a collaboration with id=10 is deleted, and subsequently a new collaboration is created with id=10, the authenticated users in that collaboration could potentially see results of the deleted collaboration in some cases. Version 4.0.0 contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2023-10-11T20:15:10.617", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vantage6"], "productName": ["vantage6"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-rf54-7qrr-96j6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 2000752, "TypeScript": 630932, "HTML": 228746, "SCSS": 25580, "Makefile": 13676, "Dockerfile": 9057, "Jinja": 5970, "Shell": 4282, "JavaScript": 802}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94541125?v=4", "stargazers": 32, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
