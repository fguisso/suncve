The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters."], "published": "2021-12-20T22:15:07.817", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["yhatt"], "productName": ["jsx-slack"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-hp68-xhvj-x6j6", "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/commit/46bc88391d89d5fda4ce689e18ca080bcdd29ecc"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["slack", "slack-block-kit", "slack-blockkit"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 378341, "JavaScript": 17487}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3993388?v=4", "stargazers": 473, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
