Users of hosted Streamlit app(s) were vulnerable to a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious URL with Javascript payloads to a Streamlit app. The attacker could then trick the user into visiting the malicious URL and, if successful, the server would render the malicious javascript payload as-is, leading to XSS. Version 0.81.0 contains a patch for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-03-16T21:15:13.270", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["streamlit"], "productName": ["streamlit"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/security/advisories/GHSA-9c6g-qpgj-rvxw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/commit/afcf880c60e5d7538936cc2d9721b9e1bc02b075"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-analysis", "data-science", "data-visualization", "deep-learning", "developer-tools", "machine-learning", "python", "streamlit"], "langs": {"Python": 5733456, "TypeScript": 3943666, "JavaScript": 66465, "HTML": 17078, "Makefile": 16890, "SCSS": 6463, "Shell": 3688, "Batchfile": 676}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45109972?v=4", "stargazers": 38634, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
