This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. This functionality is also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. Version 1.7.0 patched the Reflected XSS issue, however, the arbitrary shortcode execution issue remains."], "published": "2025-01-07T04:15:08.337", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tobias_conrad"], "productName": ["Design for Contact Form 7 Style WordPress Plugin – CF7 WOW Styler"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
