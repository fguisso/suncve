The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming CoAP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed CoAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force the CoAP server to stop, interrupting communication to the IoT endpoints."], "published": "2020-04-15T21:15:35.200", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
