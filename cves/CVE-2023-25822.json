Prior to version 5.10.0 of the `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module, corresponding to ReportPortal version 23.2, the ReportPortal database becomes unstable and reporting almost fully stops except for small launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path field is exceeded the allowable `ltree` field type indexing limit (path length>=120, approximately recursive nesting of the nested steps). REINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx and path_idx aren't helped. The problem was fixed in `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module version 5.10.0 (product release 23.2), where the maximum number of nested elements were programmatically limited. A workaround is available. After deletion of the data with long paths, and reindexing both indexes (path_gist_idx and path_idx), the database becomes stable and ReportPortal works properly."], "published": "2023-10-09T14:15:10.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["reportportal"], "productName": ["reportportal"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/security/advisories/GHSA-mj24-gpw7-23m9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["automated-testing", "automation", "reporting-engine", "testing-tools"], "langs": {"Makefile": 1308}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17636279?v=4", "stargazers": 1834, "language": "Makefile"}}, "pocList": []}
