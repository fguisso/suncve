Versions 2.3.2 until 2.6.0 suffer from a bug in validating the access token, resulting in authentication bypass. The function `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey` is an async function, as the code is not using `await` to wait for the verification result. Every time the function responds back with success, along with an unhandled exception if the token is invalid. A patch is available in version 2.6.0."], "published": "2022-05-31T23:15:07.897", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ramank775"], "productName": ["chat-server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xx4j-qqpp-v277"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["chat", "chatserver", "kafka", "microservices-architecture", "nats", "nats-jetstream"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 188383, "HTML": 5932, "Shell": 2016, "Dockerfile": 1352}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24293550?v=4", "stargazers": 39, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
