Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10, \n  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S7, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S6, \n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S5, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S3, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R2;Â \n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10 -EVO,\n  *  All versions of 21.2-EVO,\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S9-EVO,\n  *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S5-EVO,\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-EVO,\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R2-EVO."], "published": "2024-07-10T23:15:12.617", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS", "Junos OS Evolved"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
