Applications using `werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser` corresponding to a version of Werkzeug prior to 3.0.6 to parse `multipart/form-data` requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 fixes this issue."], "published": "2024-10-25T20:15:04.530", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pallets"], "productName": ["werkzeug"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-q34m-jh98-gwm2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pallets/quart/commit/5e78c4169b8eb66b91ead3e62d44721b9e1644ee", "https://github.com/pallets/quart/commit/abb04a512496206de279225340ed022852fbf51f", "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/50cfeebcb0727e18cc52ffbeb125f4a66551179b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["http", "pallets", "python", "werkzeug", "wsgi"], "langs": {"Python": 1061077, "JavaScript": 10068, "CSS": 6078, "Shell": 165, "HTML": 124}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16748505?v=4", "stargazers": 6734, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
