Prior to commit 82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8, any contact may forge a sync message, impersonating another device of the local user. The origin of sync messages is not checked. Patched libsignal-service can be found after commit 82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8. The `Metadata` struct contains an additional `was_encrypted` field, which breaks the API, but should be easily resolvable. No known workarounds are available."], "published": "2025-02-13T16:16:48.913", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["whisperfish"], "productName": ["libsignal-service-rs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-r58q-66g9-h6g8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/commit/82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 320031, "RenderScript": 2891, "Shell": 732}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82575565?v=4", "stargazers": 70, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
