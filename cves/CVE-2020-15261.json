Since Veyon users (both students and teachers) usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability is only dangerous in anyway unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in version 4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation of the vulnerability can be prevented by revoking administrative privileges from all potentially untrustworthy users."], "published": "2020-10-19T22:15:13.093", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["veyon"], "productName": ["veyon"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/veyon/veyon/security/advisories/GHSA-c8cc-x786-hqqp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/veyon/veyon/commit/f231ec511b9a09f43f49b2c7bb7c60b8046276b1"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/veyon/veyon/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C++": 1896347, "C": 250860, "CMake": 95352, "QML": 20962, "Roff": 18877, "Dockerfile": 8920, "Shell": 5638, "Java": 2021}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26358394?v=4", "stargazers": 1409, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/yaoyao-cool/CVE-2020-15261", "https://github.com/yaoyao-cool/CVE-2020-15261"]}
