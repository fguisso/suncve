This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain sensitive information."], "published": "2019-05-16T01:29:00.360", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Prime Infrastructure "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
