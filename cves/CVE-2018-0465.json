The vulnerability exists because the affected management interface performs insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information."], "published": "2018-10-05T14:29:04.357", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
