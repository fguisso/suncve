A directory traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and their variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files."], "published": "2023-09-25T20:15:10.220", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["RHINT Camel-K-1.10.1", "RHPAM 7.13.1 async", "A-MQ Clients 2", "Red Hat A-MQ Online", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel for Spring Boot", "Red Hat build of Quarkus", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Decision Manager 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Integration Camel Quarkus", "Red Hat Integration Change Data Capture", "Red Hat Integration Service Registry", "Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 7", "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack", "Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6", "Red Hat JBoss Fuse 7", "Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6", "Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3", "Red Hat JBoss Web Server 5", "Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes", "Red Hat Process Automation 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7", "Red Hat Software Collections", "Red Hat support for Spring Boot"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
