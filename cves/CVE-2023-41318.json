In affected versions an attacker could upload a malicious piece of media to the media repo, which would then be served with `Content-Disposition: inline` upon download. This vulnerability could be leveraged to execute scripts embedded in SVG content. Commits `77ec235` and `bf8abdd` fix the issue and are included in the 1.3.0 release. Operators should upgrade to v1.3.0 as soon as possible. Operators unable to upgrade should override the `Content-Disposition` header returned by matrix-media-repo as a workaround."], "published": "2023-09-08T20:15:14.693", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["turt2live"], "productName": ["matrix-media-repo"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/security/advisories/GHSA-5crw-6j7v-xc72"], "commits": ["https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/commit/77ec2354e8f46d5ef149d1dcaf25f51c04149137", "https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/commit/bf8abdd7a5371118e280c65a8e0ec2b2e9bdaf59"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "homeserver", "matrix", "matrix-media", "media", "s3"], "langs": {"Go": 694157, "HTML": 4647, "Dockerfile": 2015, "Shell": 1967, "PLpgSQL": 1669}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34485050?v=4", "stargazers": 219, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
