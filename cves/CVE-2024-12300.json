It's important to note the file is deleted immediately and double extension attacks only work on select servers making this unlikely to be successfully exploited."], "published": "2024-12-13T04:15:05.073", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["webandprint"], "productName": ["AR for WordPress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
