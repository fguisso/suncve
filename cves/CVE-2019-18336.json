Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp (Profinet) could cause the affected device to go into defect mode. A restart is required in order to recover the system. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have network access to port 102/tcp, with no authentication. No user interation is required. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."], "published": "2020-03-10T20:15:18.633", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Siemens AG"], "productName": ["SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants)", "SIMATIC TDC CP51M1", "SIMATIC TDC CPU555", "SINUMERIK 840D sl", "SINUMERIK 840D sl"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
