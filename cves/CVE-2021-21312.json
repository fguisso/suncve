And then once you return to the summary documents page, by clicking on the \"Web Link\" of the newly created file it will create a new empty tab, but on the initial tab the pop-up \"1\" will appear."], "published": "2021-03-03T20:15:12.060", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["glpi-project"], "productName": ["glpi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-c7f6-3mr7-3rq2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-c7f6-3mr7-3rq2", "kw": ["payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asset-manager", "assets-management", "cmdb", "data-center", "dcim", "glpi", "hacktoberfest", "helpdesk", "impact-analysis", "inventory", "itam", "itil", "itsm", "license-management", "ticketing"], "langs": {"PHP": 25927534, "Twig": 1977445, "JavaScript": 1591024, "SCSS": 378409, "Vue": 194660, "Shell": 24819, "Makefile": 2692, "CSS": 1716, "Dockerfile": 668}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13361707?v=4", "stargazers": 4673, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
