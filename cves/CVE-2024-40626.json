A type confusion issue was found in ProseMirrorâ€™s rendering process that leads to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Outline. An authenticated user can create a document containing a malicious JavaScript payload. When other users view this document, the malicious Javascript can execute in the origin of Outline. Outline includes CSP rules to prevent third-party code execution, however in the case of self-hosting and having your file storage on the same domain as Outline a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.77.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"], "published": "2024-07-16T17:15:11.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["outline"], "productName": ["outline"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/outline/outline/security/advisories/GHSA-888c-mvg8-v6wh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/outline/outline/security/advisories/GHSA-888c-mvg8-v6wh", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/outline/outline/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["docker", "hacktoberfest", "javascript", "mobx", "nodejs", "react", "slack", "wiki"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 4862578, "JavaScript": 205355, "HTML": 3688, "Dockerfile": 1358, "Makefile": 635, "Procfile": 134, "Shell": 65}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1765001?v=4", "stargazers": 31464, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
