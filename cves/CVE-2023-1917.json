This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: A partial fix for the issue was introduced in version 10.0.1, and an additional patch (version 10.0.2) was released to address a workaround."], "published": "2023-06-09T06:15:59.717", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["amandato"], "productName": ["PowerPress Podcasting plugin by Blubrry"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
