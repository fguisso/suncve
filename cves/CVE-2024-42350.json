Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it: 1. the public key of the previous block (used in the signature), 2. the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair. Tokens with third-party blocks containing `trusted` annotations generated through a third party block request. This has been addressed in version 4 of the specification. Users are advised to update their implementations to conform. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-08-05T20:15:36.697", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["biscuit-auth"], "productName": ["biscuit"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/security/advisories/GHSA-rgqv-mwc3-c78m"], "commits": ["https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/commit/c87cbb5d778964d6574df3e9e6579567cad12fff"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 147551, "C++": 5306}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/197278592?v=4", "stargazers": 1005, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
