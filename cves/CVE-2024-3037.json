To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server. \n\nImportant: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which typically restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log in to the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.\n\nNote: This CVE has been split into two separate CVEs (CVE-2024-3037 and CVE-2024-8404) and it’s been rescored with a \"Privileges Required (PR)\" rating of low, and “Attack Complexity (AC)” rating of low, reflecting the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard users on the host server."], "published": "2024-05-14T15:39:48.660", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PaperCut"], "productName": ["PaperCut NG, PaperCut MF"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
