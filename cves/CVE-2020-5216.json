If user-supplied input was passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a newline could be injected leading to limited header injection. Upon seeing a newline in the header, rails will silently create a new Content-Security-Policy header with the remaining value of the original string. It will continue to create new headers for each newline. This has been fixed in 6.3.0, 5.2.0, and 3.9.0."], "published": "2020-01-23T03:15:10.683", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Twitter"], "productName": ["secure_headers"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/twitter/secure_headers/security/advisories/GHSA-w978-rmpf-qmwg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/twitter/secure_headers/commit/301695706f6a70517c2a90c6ef9b32178440a2d0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/twitter/secure_headers/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["content-security-policy", "cookie", "csp", "hsts", "middleware", "rack", "referrer-policy", "ruby", "secure-headers", "xframe-options"], "langs": {"Ruby": 161206}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4", "stargazers": 3169, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
