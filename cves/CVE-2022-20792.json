The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking that may result in a multi-byte heap buffer overwflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a crafted CDB ClamAV signature database file in the ClamAV database directory. An exploit could allow the attacker to run code as the clamav user."], "published": "2022-08-10T09:15:08.197", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
