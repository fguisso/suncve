A vulnerability in federated share exists in versions prior to 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2. An attacker can gain access to basic information about users of a server by accessing a public link that a legitimate server user added as a federated share. This happens because Nextcloud supports sharing registered users with other Nextcloud servers, which can be done automatically when selecting the \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" setting. The vulnerability is patched in versions 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2 As a workaround, disable \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" in the Nextcloud settings."], "published": "2021-06-01T22:15:08.173", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nextcloud"], "productName": ["security-advisories"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-j875-vr2q-h6x6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cve", "nextcloud", "security", "security-advisories"], "langs": {"PHP": 11445, "Hack": 1058}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19211038?v=4", "stargazers": 63, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
