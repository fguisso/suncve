The attacker must authenticate with valid user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of a Bash shell command that allows role-based access control (RBAC) to be bypassed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the Bash prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privilege level by executing commands that should be restricted to other roles. For example, a dev-ops user could escalate their privilege level to admin with a successful exploit of this vulnerability."], "published": "2019-03-06T22:29:00.293", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Nexus 3000 Series Switches", "Nexus 3500 Platform Switches", "Nexus 3600 Platform Switches", "Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches", "Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode", "Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
