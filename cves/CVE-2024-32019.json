In affected versions the `ndsudo` tool shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows an attacker to run arbitrary programs with root permissions. The `ndsudo` tool is packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the SUID bit set. It only runs a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths are supplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to control where `ndsudo` looks for these commands, which may be a path the attacker has write access to. This may lead to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and 1.45.2-169. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-04-12T21:15:12.133", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["netdata"], "productName": ["netdata"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/advisories/GHSA-pmhq-4cxq-wj93"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/advisories/GHSA-pmhq-4cxq-wj93", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/netdata/netdata/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["alerting", "cncf", "data-visualization", "database", "devops", "docker", "grafana", "influxdb", "kubernetes", "linux", "machine-learning", "mongodb", "monitoring", "mysql", "netdata", "observability", "postgresql", "prometheus", "raspberry-pi", "statsd"], "langs": {"C": 22947583, "Go": 5713300, "Shell": 869440, "Jupyter Notebook": 826673, "Python": 785742, "C++": 478844, "CMake": 230072, "Rich Text Format": 42471, "HTML": 31489, "NSIS": 12969, "Batchfile": 10873, "POV-Ray SDL": 6860, "PowerShell": 6115, "Dockerfile": 5247, "JavaScript": 2983, "Makefile": 1707}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43390781?v=4", "stargazers": 73995, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
