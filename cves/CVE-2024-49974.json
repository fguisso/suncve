In addition, AFAICT each async\nCOPY can copy an unlimited number of 4MB chunks, so can run for a\nlong time. Thus IMO async COPY can become a DoS vector.\n\nAdd a restriction mechanism that bounds the number of concurrent\nbackground COPY operations. Start simple and try to be fair -- this\npatch implements a per-namespace limit.\n\nAn async COPY request that occurs while this limit is exceeded gets\nNFS4ERR_DELAY. The requesting client can choose to send the request\nagain after a delay or fall back to a traditional read/write style\ncopy.\n\nIf there is need to make the mechanism more sophisticated, we can\nvisit that in future patches."], "published": "2024-10-21T18:15:18.227", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
