Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver."], "published": "2017-03-28T02:59:01.340", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Revive Adserver All versions before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/05b1eceb"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 27483082, "JavaScript": 1095380, "HTML": 1041508, "CSS": 237772, "XSLT": 130214, "Smarty": 7889, "Shell": 7459}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5091572?v=4", "stargazers": 1311, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
