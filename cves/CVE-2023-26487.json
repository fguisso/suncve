The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0."], "published": "2023-03-04T00:15:15.563", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vega"], "productName": ["vega"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-w5m3-xh75-mp55"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vega/vega/commit/01adb034f24727d3bb321bbbb6696a7f4cd91689"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-w5m3-xh75-mp55", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/vega/vega/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["canvas", "d3", "svg", "vega", "visualization", "visualization-grammar"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1463685, "TypeScript": 481449, "HTML": 21704, "Shell": 3433}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11796929?v=4", "stargazers": 11434, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
