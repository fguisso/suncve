The vulnerability is due to an insufficient authentication mechanism used to establish a VNC session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting an administrator VNC session request prior to login. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to watch the administrator console session or interact with it, allowing admin access to the affected device."], "published": "2019-08-07T21:15:11.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
