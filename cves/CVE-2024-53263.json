When Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By inserting URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials. This problem exists in all previous versions and is patched in v3.6.1. All users should upgrade to v3.6.1. There are no workarounds known at this time."], "published": "2025-01-14T20:15:28.610", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["git-lfs"], "productName": ["git-lfs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q6r2-x2cc-vrp7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/0345b6f816e611d050c0df67b61f0022916a1c90"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["git", "git-lfs", "go"], "langs": {"Go": 1429094, "Shell": 835907, "Makefile": 29370, "Ruby": 14261, "Inno Setup": 9061, "Batchfile": 107}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20246716?v=4", "stargazers": 13356, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
