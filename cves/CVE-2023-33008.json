Apache Johnzon 1.2.21 mitigates this by setting a scale limit of 1000 (by default) to the BigDecimal. \n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Johnzon: through 1.2.20.\n\n"], "published": "2023-07-07T10:15:09.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Johnzon"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
