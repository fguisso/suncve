By prematurely destroying annotation objects, a specially-crafted PDF document can trigger the reuse of previously freed memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially-crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled."], "published": "2022-11-21T16:15:12.627", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Foxit"], "productName": ["Foxit Reader"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
