Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results."], "published": "2020-05-19T14:15:11.987", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ISC"], "productName": ["BIND9"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/knqyf263/CVE-2020-8617", "https://github.com/gothburz/cve-2020-8617", "https://github.com/knqyf263/CVE-2020-8617", "https://github.com/gothburz/cve-2020-8617"]}
