Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them."], "published": "2024-02-21T23:15:08.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pinterest"], "productName": ["querybook"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-fh6g-gvvp-587f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/commit/bc620dabaaf13ff1dcb30af0b46a490403fb9908"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["analyses", "celery", "charting", "flask", "hive", "metastore", "notebook", "presto", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2623626, "Python": 1410681, "SCSS": 193957, "MDX": 170543, "JavaScript": 107305, "Shell": 5592, "Dockerfile": 2516, "Makefile": 1974, "HTML": 1532, "Mustache": 1283, "Mako": 494, "CSS": 482}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/541152?v=4", "stargazers": 2071, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
