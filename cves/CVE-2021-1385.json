This vulnerability occurs because the device does not properly validate URIs in IOx API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the underlying operating system."], "published": "2021-03-24T20:15:13.837", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS "], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-hhfw-6cm2-v3w5"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-hhfw-6cm2-v3w5", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 3866, "Java": 873, "Makefile": 40}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48210684?v=4", "stargazers": 11, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
