All React applications built with react-admin and using the `<RichTextField>` are affected. `<RichTextField>` outputs the field value using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without client-side sanitization. If the data isn't sanitized server-side, this opens a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 now use `DOMPurify` to escape the HTML before outputting it with React and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Users who already sanitize HTML data server-side do not need to upgrade. As a workaround, users may replace the `<RichTextField>` by a custom field doing sanitization by hand."], "published": "2023-02-13T21:15:15.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["marmelab"], "productName": ["react-admin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-5jcr-82fh-339v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-5jcr-82fh-339v", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admin", "admin-dashboard", "admin-on-rest", "admin-ui", "frontend-framework", "graphql", "material-ui", "react", "react-admin", "reactjs", "rest", "single-page-app"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5332960, "JavaScript": 94955, "Shell": 8934, "Makefile": 5525, "HTML": 4756}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3116319?v=4", "stargazers": 25609, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
