Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation. This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2024-05-27T17:15:09.760", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rack"], "productName": ["rack-contrib"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/commit/0eec2a9836329051c6742549e65a94a4c24fe6f7"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 153659, "HTML": 93}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42379?v=4", "stargazers": 1258, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
