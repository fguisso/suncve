This has been remedied in versions 5.1.2 and 5.5.2 to ensure buffer always grows as needed for any input."], "published": "2019-09-10T18:15:12.367", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
