The session cookie for all users is set with the default `SameSite=Lax` and does not have the `Secure` flag enabled, allowing the session cookie to be sent over HTTP to a cross-origin domain. An attacker can exploit this by embedding a malicious markdown image in a chat, which, when viewed by an administrator, sends the admin's session cookie to the attacker's server. This can lead to a stealthy administrator account takeover, potentially resulting in remote code execution (RCE) due to the elevated privileges of administrator accounts."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:36.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["open-webui"], "productName": ["open-webui/open-webui"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
