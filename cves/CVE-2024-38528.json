There is a missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.3.\n"], "published": "2024-06-28T20:15:02.533", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pendulum-project"], "productName": ["ntpd-rs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-2xpx-vcmq-5f72"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["clock", "ntp", "ntp-client", "ntp-protocol", "ntp-server", "ntpd", "time", "time-synchronization"], "langs": {"Rust": 1089343, "Shell": 11671}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124210749?v=4", "stargazers": 853, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
