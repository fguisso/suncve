It follows symlinks in this location or uses directories owned by unprivileged users. Because Timeshift also executes scripts under this location, an attacker can attempt to win a race condition to replace scripts created by Timeshift with attacker-controlled scripts. Upon success, an attacker-controlled script is executed with full root privileges. This logic is practically always triggered when Timeshift runs regardless of the command-line arguments used."], "published": "2020-03-05T16:15:11.940", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift/commit/335b3d5398079278b8f7094c77bfd148b315b462"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Vala": 672566, "Makefile": 6350, "Shell": 5512}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12488854?v=4", "stargazers": 4734, "language": "Vala"}}, "pocList": []}
