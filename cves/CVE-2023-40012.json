Versions of uthenticode prior to the 2.x series did not check Extended Key Usages in certificates, in violation of the Authenticode X.509 certificate profile. As a result, a malicious user could produce a \"signed\" PE file that uthenticode would verify and consider valid using an X.509 certificate that isn't entitled to produce code signatures (e.g., a SSL certificate). By design, uthenticode does not perform full-chain validation. However, the absence of EKU validation was an unintended oversight. The 2.0.0 release series includes EKU checks. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-08-09T16:15:10.060", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["trailofbits"], "productName": ["uthenticode"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/security/advisories/GHSA-gm2f-j4rj-6xqj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/commit/caeb1eb62412605f71bd96ce9bb9420644b6db53"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["authenticode", "code-signing", "cpp", "cryptography", "hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"C++": 57833, "CMake": 5911, "Makefile": 929, "Shell": 892, "Dockerfile": 805}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2314423?v=4", "stargazers": 148, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
