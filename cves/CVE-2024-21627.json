Prior to versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11, some event attributes are not detected by the `isCleanHTML` method. Some modules using the `isCleanHTML` method could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11 contain a patch for this issue. The best workaround is to use the `HTMLPurifier` library to sanitize html input coming from users. The library is already available as a dependency in the PrestaShop project. Beware though that in legacy object models, fields of `HTML` type will call `isCleanHTML`."], "published": "2024-01-02T21:15:10.467", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PrestaShop"], "productName": ["PrestaShop"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-xgpm-q3mq-46rq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/73cfb44666818eefd501b526a894fe884dd12129", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/ba06d18466df5b92cb841d504cc7210121104883"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-framework", "ecommerce-platform", "hacktoberfest", "php", "php-framework", "prestashop"], "langs": {"PHP": 29299808, "TypeScript": 8884974, "Gherkin": 2686538, "Twig": 2497624, "HTML": 1695839, "JavaScript": 1449813, "Smarty": 993383, "SCSS": 501630, "Vue": 331001, "CSS": 163083, "Less": 19680, "Shell": 15714, "Makefile": 1814, "Dockerfile": 1141}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2815696?v=4", "stargazers": 8493, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
