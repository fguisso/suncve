The vulnerability stems from the lack of protections on the API endpoint receiving instructions, enabling an attacker to direct a user running AutoGPT in their local network to a malicious website. This site can then send crafted requests to the AutoGPT server, leading to command execution. The issue is exacerbated by CORS being enabled for arbitrary origins by default, allowing the attacker to read the response of all cross-site queries. This vulnerability was addressed in version 5.1."], "published": "2024-06-06T18:15:12.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["significant-gravitas"], "productName": ["significant-gravitas/autogpt"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/26324f29849967fa72c207da929af612f1740669"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "artificial-intelligence", "autonomous-agents", "gpt-4", "openai", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 2878491, "TypeScript": 1258928, "Dart": 203562, "PLpgSQL": 44427, "Jinja": 31626, "C++": 23419, "CMake": 18862, "JavaScript": 14039, "MDX": 12901, "CSS": 10735, "Shell": 5870, "Dockerfile": 4777, "HTML": 3023, "Ruby": 2803, "Swift": 2384, "C": 1425, "Elixir": 1068, "Batchfile": 478, "Kotlin": 140, "Objective-C": 38}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130738209?v=4", "stargazers": 174211, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
