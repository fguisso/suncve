This\nordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's\nreceive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when\nSERPORT_ACTIVE is set.\n\nThis is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1\n(\"platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition\") where\ndevm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the\ndevice.\n\nFix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via\ndevm_serdev_device_open().\n\nNote, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control()\ncalls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call."], "published": "2025-02-12T14:15:32.577", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
