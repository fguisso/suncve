Versions 2.2.1 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use libcue to parse the file. The file exploits the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This issue is patched in version 2.3.0."], "published": "2023-10-09T22:15:12.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["lipnitsk"], "productName": ["libcue"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue/security/advisories/GHSA-5982-x7hv-r9cj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue/commit/cfb98a060fd79dbc3463d85f0f29c3c335dfa0ea", "https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue/commit/fdf72c8bded8d24cfa0608b8e97f2eed210a920e"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue/security/advisories/GHSA-5982-x7hv-r9cj", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 46018, "Yacc": 6638, "Lex": 4463, "CMake": 3243, "C++": 1547, "Shell": 473, "CUE": 1}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/438785?v=4", "stargazers": 59, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
