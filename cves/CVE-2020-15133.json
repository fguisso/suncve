The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the `EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This method does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that it does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any `wss:` connection made using this library is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server it is connected to. For further background information on this issue, please see the referenced GitHub Advisory. Upgrading `faye-websocket` to v0.11.0 is recommended."], "published": "2020-07-31T18:15:14.473", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["faye"], "productName": ["faye-websocket"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-2v5c-755p-p4gv"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-ruby/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 38414}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1277447?v=4", "stargazers": 1049, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
