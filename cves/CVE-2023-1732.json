In rare deployment cases (error thrown by the Read() function), this could lead to a predictable shared secret.\n\nThe tkn20 and blindrsa components did not check whether enough randomness was returned from the user provided randomness source. Typically the user provides crypto/rand.Reader, which in the vast majority of cases will always return the right number random bytes. In the cases where it does not, or the user provides a source that does not, the blinding for blindrsa is weak and integrity of the plaintext is not ensured in tkn20.\n\n"], "published": "2023-05-10T12:15:10.523", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cloudflare"], "productName": ["CIRCL"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/security/advisories/GHSA-2q89-485c-9j2x"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["circl", "cryptography", "csidh", "dilithium", "ed25519", "ed448", "elliptic-curves", "go", "golang", "hpke", "kyber", "pki", "post-quantum", "sidh"], "langs": {"Go": 2038992, "Assembly": 525564, "C": 51184, "Makefile": 1667, "Awk": 105}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/314135?v=4", "stargazers": 1394, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
