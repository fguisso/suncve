A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_matroska_demux_update_tracks function within matroska-demux.c. The vulnerability occurs when the gst_caps_is_equal function is called with invalid caps values. If this happen, then in the function gst_buffer_get_size the call to GST_BUFFER_MEM_PTR can return a null pointer. Attempting to dereference the size field of this null pointer results in a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:32.033", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
