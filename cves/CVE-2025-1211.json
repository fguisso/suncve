Given the URL http://127.0.0.1?@127.2.2.2/, the URI function will parse and see the host as 127.0.0.1 (which is correct), and hackney will refer the host as 127.2.2.2/. \rThis vulnerability can be exploited when users rely on the URL function for host checking."], "published": "2025-02-11T05:15:14.013", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["hackney"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/commit/9594ce58fabd32cd897fc28fae937694515a3d4a"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["client", "erlang", "http"], "langs": {"Erlang": 431943}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14498?v=4", "stargazers": 1350, "language": "Erlang"}}, "pocList": []}
