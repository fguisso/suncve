The HtmlGenerator class is subject to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through a parsed malformed Minecraft server MOTD. The HtmlGenerator iterates through objects of MotdItem that are contained in an object of MotdItemCollection to generate a HTML string. An attacker can make malicious inputs to the color and text properties of MotdItem to inject own HTML into a web page during web page generation. For example by sending a malicious MOTD from a Minecraft server under their control that was queried and passed to the HtmlGenerator. This XSS vulnerability exists because the values of these properties are neither filtered nor escaped. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.6."], "published": "2024-10-04T15:15:13.213", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jgniecki"], "productName": ["MinecraftMotdParser"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jgniecki/MinecraftMotdParser/security/advisories/GHSA-q898-frwq-f3qp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jgniecki/MinecraftMotdParser/commit/b0ab9d68a964cd3d74977f39a9e7af0a94509f7c"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/jgniecki/MinecraftMotdParser/security/advisories/GHSA-q898-frwq-f3qp", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/jgniecki/MinecraftMotdParser/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["generator", "mineceraft", "motd", "parser", "php"], "langs": {"PHP": 73388}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19625445?v=4", "stargazers": 2, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
