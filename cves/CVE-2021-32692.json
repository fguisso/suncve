Versions prior to 0.11.0 allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on any macOS machine with ActivityWatch running. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by having the user visiting a website with the page title set to a malicious string. An attacker could use another application to accomplish the same, but the web browser is the most likely attack vector. This issue is patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users can run the latest version of aw-watcher-window from source, or manually patch the `printAppTitle.scpt` file."], "published": "2022-12-23T03:15:07.623", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ActivityWatch"], "productName": ["Activity Watch"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/security/advisories/GHSA-3x6w-q32m-jqf3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activitywatch", "afk", "analytics", "app", "cross-platform", "dashboard", "productivity", "quantified-self", "time-tracker", "time-tracking", "timetracker", "timetracking"], "langs": {"Python": 34800, "Inno Setup": 2731, "Batchfile": 203}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18249061?v=4", "stargazers": 13883, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
