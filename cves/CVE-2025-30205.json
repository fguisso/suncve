Prior to version 1.2.0, a faulty function intrumentation in the (optional) kanidm patches provided by kandim-provision will cause the provisioned admin credentials to be leaked to the system log. This only impacts users which both use the provided patches and provision their `admin` or `idm_admin` account credentials this way. No other credentials are affected. Users should recompile kanidm with the newest patchset from tag `v1.2.0` or higher. As a workaround, the user can set the log level `KANIDM_LOG_LEVEL` to any level higher than `info`, for example `warn`."], "published": "2025-03-24T17:15:21.667", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["oddlama"], "productName": ["kanidm-provision"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/security/advisories/GHSA-57fc-pcqm-53rp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/commit/a102b52e4a79be4263068577ba837f16c3e487a2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["kanidm", "provisioning"], "langs": {"Nix": 62027, "Rust": 37240, "Shell": 10}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31919558?v=4", "stargazers": 44, "language": "Nix"}}, "pocList": []}
