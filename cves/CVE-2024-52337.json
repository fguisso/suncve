This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations."], "published": "2024-11-26T16:15:17.717", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Fast Datapath for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Fast Datapath for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Fast Datapath for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Telecommunications Update Service", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 Extended Update Support", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
