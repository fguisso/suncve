This occurs in settings.php. To exploit this, an attacker would request a backup of limited files via teleporter.php. These are placed into a .tar.gz archive. The attacker then modifies the host parameter in dnsmasq.d files, and then compresses and uploads these files again."], "published": "2020-06-23T14:15:12.950", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/commit/c949516ee15fa6a9b0c8511cc4c4d6b0893f3e69", "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/commit/8f6e1365b6dec0ae1aa0b0b15b102c9133f347e5"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admin", "dashboard", "pi-hole"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 299833, "CSS": 286052, "Answer Set Programming": 189548, "Dockerfile": 128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16827203?v=4", "stargazers": 2203, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
