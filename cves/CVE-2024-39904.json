Prior to 3.18.1, a code execution vulnerability existed in VNote, which allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary programs on the victim's system. A crafted URI can be used in a note to perform this attack using file:/// as a link. For example, file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary programs by embedding a reference to a local executable file such as file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe and file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/calc.exe. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating and sharing specially crafted notes. An attacker could send a crafted note file and perform further attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.18.1."], "published": "2024-07-11T16:15:04.860", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vnotex"], "productName": ["vnote"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/security/advisories/GHSA-vhh5-8wcv-68gj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/commit/3477469b669708ff547037fda9fc2817870428aa"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/security/advisories/GHSA-vhh5-8wcv-68gj", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept", "steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["editor", "markdown", "mathjax", "note", "note-taking", "uml", "vim", "vnote"], "langs": {"C++": 2288788, "JavaScript": 1425195, "CSS": 205346, "CMake": 29329, "HTML": 27928, "Rich Text Format": 18666, "Python": 1610}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48284031?v=4", "stargazers": 12218, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
