Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21."], "published": "2024-07-24T18:15:05.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["argoproj"], "productName": ["argo-cd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-v8wx-v5jq-qhhw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/05edb2a9ca48f0f10608c1b49fbb0cf7164f6476", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/e96f32d233504101ddac028a5bf8117433d333d6", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/ef535230d8bd8ad7b18aab1ea1063e9751d348c4"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-v8wx-v5jq-qhhw", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["argo", "argo-cd", "cd", "ci-cd", "cicd", "continuous-delivery", "continuous-deployment", "devops", "docker", "gitops", "hacktoberfest", "helm", "jsonnet", "kubernetes", "kustomize", "pipeline"], "langs": {"Go": 6874433, "TypeScript": 1314767, "Lua": 210938, "SCSS": 93949, "Shell": 58360, "Makefile": 25024, "Dockerfile": 15364, "Procfile": 10040, "JavaScript": 5975, "CSS": 2209, "Mustache": 1066, "HTML": 895}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30269780?v=4", "stargazers": 19120, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
