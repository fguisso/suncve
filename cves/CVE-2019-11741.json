Because addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.com have close ties to the Firefox product, malicious manipulation of these sites within the browser can potentially be used to modify a user's Firefox configuration. These two sites will now be isolated into their own process and not allowed to be loaded in a standard content process.
