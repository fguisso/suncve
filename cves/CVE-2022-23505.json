In versions prior to 4.6.3, a remote attacker may be able to bypass WSFed authentication on a website using passport-wsfed-saml2. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed assertion. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. This issue is patched in version 4.6.3. Use of SAML2 authentication instead of WSFed is a workaround."], "published": "2022-12-13T08:15:09.067", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["auth0"], "productName": ["passport-wsfed-saml2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/auth0/passport-wsfed-saml2/security/advisories/GHSA-ppjq-qxhx-m25f"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/auth0/passport-wsfed-saml2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 243980, "EJS": 1218}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2824157?v=4", "stargazers": 49, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
