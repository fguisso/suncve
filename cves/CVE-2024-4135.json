This is due to the plugin allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a user-supplied value prior to using that value in a call to do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes."], "published": "2024-05-08T10:15:08.360", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["joomunited"], "productName": ["WP Latest Posts"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
