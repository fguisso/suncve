Cap'n Proro prior to versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3, as well as versions of Cap'n Proto's Rust implementation prior to 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read due to logic error handling list-of-list. This issue may lead someone to remotely segfault a peer by sending it a malicious message, if the victim performs certain actions on a list-of-pointer type. Exfiltration of memory is possible if the victim performs additional certain actions on a list-of-pointer type. To be vulnerable, an application must perform a specific sequence of actions, described in the GitHub Security Advisory. The bug is present in inlined code, therefore the fix will require rebuilding dependent applications. Cap'n Proto has C++ fixes available in versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3. The `capnp` Rust crate has fixes available in versions 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2."], "published": "2022-11-30T17:15:10.097", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["capnproto"], "productName": ["capnproto"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/security/advisories/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/commit/25d34c67863fd960af34fc4f82a7ca3362ee74b9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C++": 7859169, "Cap'n Proto": 216366, "Shell": 60601, "CMake": 52207, "Starlark": 33680, "Makefile": 31296, "M4": 30787, "Python": 3926, "Emacs Lisp": 2197, "C": 1631}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29186932?v=4", "stargazers": 12063, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
