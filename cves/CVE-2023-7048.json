This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in mystickymenu-contact-leads.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the export of a CSV file containing contact leads via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Because the CSV file is exported to a public location, it can be downloaded during a very short window of time before it is automatically deleted by the export function."], "published": "2024-01-11T09:15:55.030", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["galdub"], "productName": ["Floating Notification Bar, Sticky Menu on Scroll, Announcement Banner, and Sticky Header for Any Theme â€“ My Sticky Bar (formerly myStickymenu)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
