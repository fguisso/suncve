This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable when front-end users can submit new events with tickets."], "published": "2024-10-24T07:15:02.310", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["metagauss"], "productName": ["EventPrime – Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
