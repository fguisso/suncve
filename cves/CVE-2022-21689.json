In affected versions the receive mode limits concurrent uploads to 100 per second and blocks other uploads in the same second, which can be triggered by a simple script. An adversary with access to the receive mode can block file upload for others. There is no way to block this attack in public mode due to the anonymity properties of the tor network."], "published": "2022-01-18T22:15:07.987", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["onionshare"], "productName": ["onionshare"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-jh82-c5jw-pxpc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-jh82-c5jw-pxpc", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cross-platform", "file-sharing", "onion-service", "onionshare", "open-source", "python", "security", "tor", "tor-onion-service"], "langs": {"Python": 754203, "JavaScript": 13048, "HTML": 12068, "CSS": 6728, "Shell": 6317, "PowerShell": 1027, "Batchfile": 139}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87951521?v=4", "stargazers": 6484, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
