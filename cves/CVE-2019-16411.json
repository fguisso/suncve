By sending multiple IPv4 packets that have invalid IPv4Options, the function IPV4OptValidateTimestamp in decode-ipv4.c tries to access a memory region that is not allocated. There is a check for o->len < 5 (corresponding to 2 bytes of header and 3 bytes of data). Then, \"flag = *(o->data + 3)\" places one beyond the 3 bytes, because the code should have been \"flag = *(o->data + 1)\" instead."], "published": "2019-09-24T20:15:11.967", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
