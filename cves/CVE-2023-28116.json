In versions 4.8 and prior, an out-of-bounds write can occur in the BLE L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG operating system. The network stack of Contiki-NG uses a global buffer (packetbuf) for processing of packets, with the size of PACKETBUF_SIZE. In particular, when using the BLE L2CAP module with the default configuration, the PACKETBUF_SIZE value becomes larger then the actual size of the packetbuf. When large packets are processed by the L2CAP module, a buffer overflow can therefore occur when copying the packet data to the packetbuf. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be worked around by applying the patch manually."], "published": "2023-03-17T22:15:11.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["contiki-ng"], "productName": ["contiki-ng"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-m737-4vx6-pfqp"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["6lowpan", "6lowpan-border-router", "6tisch", "contiki-ng", "iot", "rpl", "tsch", "wsn"], "langs": {"C": 13758081, "GSC": 688626, "Python": 243324, "CSS": 53122, "Shell": 53016, "Makefile": 49706, "Linker Script": 36491, "Java": 33209, "Perl": 22060, "JavaScript": 14233, "Dockerfile": 7314, "XSLT": 4947}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067801?v=4", "stargazers": 1385, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
