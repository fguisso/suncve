The secret file stores the user's Planet API authentication information. It should only be accessible by the user, but before version 2.0.1, its permissions allowed the user's group and non-group to read the file as well. This issue was patched in version 2.0.1. As a workaround, set the secret file permissions to only user read/write by hand.\n"], "published": "2023-05-12T21:15:09.560", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["planetlabs"], "productName": ["planet-client-python"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/security/advisories/GHSA-j5fj-rfh6-qj85"], "commits": ["https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/commit/d71415a83119c5e89d7b80d5f940d162376ee3b7"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 654409, "Shell": 936}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5247016?v=4", "stargazers": 283, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
