Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\\n`). The vulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed (`\\n`). By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation of this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function, resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue is patched in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4."], "published": "2023-03-15T22:15:10.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenSIPS"], "productName": ["opensips"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-67w7-g4j8-3wcx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/c6ab3bb406c447e30c7d33a1a8970048b4612100"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 17218284, "Makefile": 128744, "Yacc": 81144, "Perl": 72729, "Python": 64356, "C++": 62693, "Shell": 36120, "M4": 32463, "XS": 31933, "Lex": 31126, "PHP": 16028, "Roff": 10751, "Vim Script": 5424, "GDB": 2914, "CMake": 461}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3853758?v=4", "stargazers": 1336, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
