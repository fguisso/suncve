In the JWT handling code, it performs signature validation but fails to validate the JWT issuer and signer identity. The signer omission, if combined with a scenario where the infrastructure owner allows internet traffic to the ALB targets (not a recommended configuration), can allow for JWT signing by an untrusted entity and an actor may be able to mimic valid OIDC-federated sessions to the ALB targets.\n\n\n\nThe repository/package has been deprecated, is end of life, and is no longer supported. As a security best practice, ensure that your ELB targets (e.g. EC2 Instances, Fargate Tasks etc.) do not have public IP addresses. Ensure any forked or derivative code validate that the signerÂ attribute in the JWT match the ARN of the Application Load Balancer that the service is configured to use."], "published": "2024-10-22T00:15:02.457", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Amazon"], "productName": ["Amazon.ApplicationLoadBalancer.Identity.AspNetCore Middleware"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore/security/advisories/GHSA-5gh5-cc5m-q244"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C#": 25065}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3299148?v=4", "stargazers": 8, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
