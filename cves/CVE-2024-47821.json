The folder `/.pyload/scripts` has scripts which are run when certain actions are completed, for e.g. a download is finished. By downloading a executable file to a folder in /scripts and performing the respective action, remote code execution can be achieved in versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev87. A file can be downloaded to such a folder by changing the download folder to a folder in `/scripts` path and using the `/flashgot` API to download the file. This vulnerability allows an attacker with access to change the settings on a pyload server to execute arbitrary code and completely compromise the system. Version 0.5.0b3.dev87 fixes this issue."], "published": "2024-10-25T23:15:02.530", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pyload"], "productName": ["pyload"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-w7hq-f2pj-c53g"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-w7hq-f2pj-c53g", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cyberlocker", "ddl", "debrid", "download", "downloader", "downloadmanager", "flashgot", "headless", "jdownloader", "linkdecrypter", "pyload", "pypi", "python", "qnap", "raspberry-pi", "synology", "webui"], "langs": {"Python": 1910527, "HTML": 176045, "JavaScript": 150348, "CSS": 44576, "Dockerfile": 3981}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3521496?v=4", "stargazers": 3468, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
