This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 and CVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems."], "published": "2017-06-19T16:29:00.420", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Trinadh465/linux-4.1.15_CVE-2017-1000371", "https://github.com/Trinadh465/linux-4.1.15_CVE-2017-1000371"]}
