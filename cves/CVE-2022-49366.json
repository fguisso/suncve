When\n\"id\" and \"uid\" have the same value, the function simply jumps out of\nthe loop without decrementing the reference count of the object\n\"posix_acls\", which is increased by get_acl() earlier. This may\nresult in memory leaks.\n\nFix it by decreasing the reference count of \"posix_acls\" before\njumping to label \"check_access_bits\"."], "published": "2025-02-26T07:01:13.230", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
