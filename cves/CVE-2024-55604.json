Users invited as \"App Viewer\" should not have access to development information of a workspace. Datasources are such a component in a workspace. Yet, in versions of Appsmith prior to 1.51, app viewers are able to get a list of datasources in a workspace they're a member of. This information disclosure does NOT expose sensitive data in the datasources, such as database passwords and API Keys. The attacker needs to have been invited to a workspace as a \"viewer\", by someone in that workspace with access to invite. The attacker then needs to be able to signup/login to that Appsmith instance. The issue is patched in version 1.51. No known workarounds are available."], "published": "2025-03-25T15:15:23.360", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["appsmithorg"], "productName": ["appsmith"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/security/advisories/GHSA-794x-gm8v-2wj6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admin-dashboard", "admin-panels", "app-builder", "automation", "crud", "custom-internal", "developer-tools", "gui", "gui-application", "hacktoberfest", "internal-tools", "java", "javascript", "low-code", "low-code-framework", "react", "self-hosted", "typescript", "webdevelopment", "workflows"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 24262188, "Java": 7790233, "JavaScript": 3522297, "CSS": 364722, "Shell": 193482, "HTML": 178857, "MDX": 90700, "Dockerfile": 6508, "Handlebars": 6339, "Smarty": 3803, "Python": 3209, "HCL": 2207, "Procfile": 84}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67620218?v=4", "stargazers": 36545, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
