Prior to version 14.10.6 of `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-core-rendering-macro-footnotes` and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-rendering-macro-footnotes` and prior to version 15.1-rc-1 of `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-rendering-macro-footnotes`, the footnote macro executed its content in a potentially different context than the one in which it was defined. In particular in combination with the include macro, this allows privilege escalation from a simple user account in XWiki to programming rights and thus remote code execution, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.1-rc-1. There is no workaround apart from upgrading to a fixed version of the footnote macro."], "published": "2023-10-25T18:17:28.613", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["xwiki"], "productName": ["xwiki-rendering"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/security/advisories/GHSA-35j5-m29r-xfq5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/5f558b8fac8b716d19999225f38cb8ed0814116e"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/security/advisories/GHSA-35j5-m29r-xfq5", "kw": ["steps:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 3269559, "AspectJ": 12229, "Groovy": 1367}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/488445?v=4", "stargazers": 72, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
