The vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition."], "published": "2018-10-17T20:29:00.253", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 3000 Series 7.0(3)I7(3)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
