In all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start. NuProcess is missing that check. This vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command line arguments on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch. As a workaround, users of the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution."], "published": "2022-09-26T14:15:10.407", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["brettwooldridge"], "productName": ["NuProcess"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/security/advisories/GHSA-cxgf-v2p8-7ph7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/commit/29bc09de561bf00ff9bf77123756363a9709f868"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 290090, "Shell": 1527, "HTML": 146}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538661?v=4", "stargazers": 728, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
