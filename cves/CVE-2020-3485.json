The vulnerability exists because the web management software does not properly handle RBAC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and delete certain screen content on the system that the attacker would not normally have privileges to access."], "published": "2020-08-26T17:15:13.943", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
