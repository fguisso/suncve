An attacker can request any `route` we want as long as we specify an `operation` that is allowed. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.0 by applying the same access control pattern as in `UI.php` to the `ajax.render.php` page which does not allow arbitrary `routes` to be dispatched. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-11-07T18:15:18.787", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Combodo"], "productName": ["iTop"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Combodo/iTop/security/advisories/GHSA-3mxr-8r3j-j2j9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Combodo/iTop/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cmdb", "hacktoberfest", "helpdesk", "impact-analysis", "it-services", "itil", "itop", "itsm", "ticket"], "langs": {"PHP": 35364363, "JavaScript": 2380754, "SCSS": 1158023, "HTML": 1103794, "Twig": 962983, "CSS": 908219, "Yacc": 61589, "Shell": 14490, "Smarty": 13798, "Batchfile": 2449}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23080253?v=4", "stargazers": 908, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
