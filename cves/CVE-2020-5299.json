This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful attack can be completed: 1. Have found a vulnerability in the victims spreadsheet software of choice. 2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim. 3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software. Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466)."], "published": "2020-06-03T22:15:11.957", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["octobercms"], "productName": ["october"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-4rhm-m2fp-hx7q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c84bf03f506052c848f2fddc05f24be631427a1a", "https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/802d8c8e09a2b342649393edb6d3ceb958851484"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["backend", "cmf", "cms", "cms-platform", "framework", "laravel", "octobercms", "php", "platform"], "langs": {"PHP": 2058359, "HTML": 84434, "CSS": 58023, "JavaScript": 22950, "Hack": 1770}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5554805?v=4", "stargazers": 11090, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
