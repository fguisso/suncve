Versions prior to 0.35.0 are subject to a Denial of Service. Users that have permissions to change Fluxâ€™s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed. This issue is patched in version 0.35.0. As a workaround, Admission controllers can be employed to restrict the values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval` and `.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the recommended mitigation."], "published": "2022-10-22T00:15:09.310", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluxcd"], "productName": ["flux2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-f4p5-x4vc-mh4v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["continuous-delivery", "gitops", "gitops-toolkit", "helm", "kubernetes", "kustomize"], "langs": {"Go": 1070721, "HCL": 9334, "Shell": 7615, "Makefile": 4535, "Dockerfile": 504}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52158677?v=4", "stargazers": 6964, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
