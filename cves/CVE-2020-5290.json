An attacker team could potentially steal flags by, for example, exploiting a stored XSS payload in a CTF challenge so that victim teams who solve the challenge are unknowingly (and against their will) signed into the attacker team&#39;s account. Then, the attacker can gain points / value off the backs of the victims. This is patched in version 2.3."], "published": "2020-04-01T20:15:15.223", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["redpwn"], "productName": ["rctf"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/redpwn/rctf/security/advisories/GHSA-p5fh-2vhw-fvpq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/redpwn/rctf/security/advisories/GHSA-p5fh-2vhw-fvpq", "kw": ["reproduction steps"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/redpwn/rctf/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ctf", "ctf-framework", "ctf-platform", "ctf-scoreboard", "ctf-tools", "ctfd", "ctftime", "education", "rctf", "security"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 202563, "TypeScript": 51235, "HTML": 8295, "Shell": 3683, "Dockerfile": 499}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46502497?v=4", "stargazers": 268, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
