A specially crafted image embedded within a document can cause a length to be miscalculated and underflow. This length is then treated as unsigned and then used in a copying operation. Due to the length underflow, the application will then write outside the bounds of a stack buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow. An attacker must convince a victim to open a document in order to trigger this vulnerability."], "published": "2018-10-01T20:29:01.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["The Atlantis Word Processor Team"], "productName": ["Atlantis Word Processor"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
