If in fact the permissions were more restrictive than intended, then this would be a functional problem but not a vulnerability."], "published": "2006-02-13T11:06:00.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
