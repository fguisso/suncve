In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter."], "published": "2021-08-31T17:15:08.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["synapse"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3x4c-pq33-4w3q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/cb35df940a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["matrix-org", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 11907179, "Rust": 95720, "HTML": 64571, "Shell": 59187, "Perl": 28191, "Nix": 12267, "Dockerfile": 12096, "JavaScript": 11988, "Jinja": 7942, "CSS": 6211, "Makefile": 634, "Gherkin": 308, "Lua": 241}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 11875, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
