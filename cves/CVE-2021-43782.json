This is a follow up to GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm/CVE-2021-41276, the initial fix was incomplete. Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. The following versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4."], "published": "2021-12-15T20:15:08.490", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Enalean"], "productName": ["tuleap"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/security/advisories/GHSA-cwv9-hhm4-jr84", "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/security/advisories/GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/commit/64e77561eba9f8233199c2962b3497ed7294a7d2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 65027037, "TypeScript": 12467121, "JavaScript": 4291524, "Vue": 3202817, "Mustache": 2180529, "SCSS": 1614627, "HTML": 502245, "CSS": 281768, "Shell": 126606, "Smarty": 121296, "MDX": 91427, "Go": 55258, "Nix": 48860, "Makefile": 41634, "Rust": 27952, "Groovy": 13915, "PEG.js": 12394, "Perl": 11384, "Dockerfile": 10302, "TeX": 7062, "Python": 3977, "XSLT": 1077, "Awk": 597, "WebAssembly": 27}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095084?v=4", "stargazers": 1050, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
