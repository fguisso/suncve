In versions 1.0 through 2.0b4, cpdb-libs is vulnerable to buffer overflows via improper use of `scanf(3)`. cpdb-libs uses the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions to parse command lines and configuration files, dropping the read string components into fixed-length buffers, but does not limit the length of the strings to be read by `fscanf()` and `scanf()` causing buffer overflows when a string is longer than 1023 characters. A patch for this issue is available at commit f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7. As all buffers have a length of 1024 characters, the patch limits the maximum string length to be read to 1023 by replacing all occurrences of `%s` with `%1023s` in all calls of the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions.\n"], "published": "2023-06-14T17:15:09.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenPrinting"], "productName": ["cpdb-libs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/security/advisories/GHSA-25j7-9gfc-f46x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/commit/f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 141062, "M4": 4400, "Makefile": 2432, "Shell": 1008}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20563597?v=4", "stargazers": 6, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
