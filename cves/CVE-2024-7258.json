This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."], "published": "2024-08-23T05:15:15.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aukejomm"], "productName": ["WooCommerce Google Feed Manager"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
