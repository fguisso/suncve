The vulnerability is due to improper processing of corrupted Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 messages toward an affected router. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ipsecmgr service to reload. A reload of this service could cause all IPsec VPN tunnels to be terminated and prevent new tunnels from being established until the service has restarted, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products when they are running Cisco StarOS: Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 5000 Series Routers, Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) System Software.
