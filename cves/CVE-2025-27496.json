When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations,  and is not logged server-side by Snowflake. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.23.1."], "published": "2025-03-13T19:15:52.050", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["snowflakedb"], "productName": ["snowflake-jdbc"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-q298-375f-5q63"], "commits": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/commit/ef81582ce2f1dbc3c8794a696c94f4fe65fad507"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["database", "java", "jdbc", "sql"], "langs": {"Java": 4899245, "Shell": 24671, "Batchfile": 5703, "Python": 4357, "Lua": 3489, "Standard ML": 833}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6453780?v=4", "stargazers": 185, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
