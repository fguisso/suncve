Prior to version 1.5.10.15, due to a lack of request sanitization in the logs, a malicious request containing XSS would be stored in a log file. When an administrator of the FOG server logged in and viewed the logs, they would be parsed as HTML and displayed accordingly. Version 1.5.10.15 contains a patch. As a workaround, view logs from an external text editor rather than the dashboard."], "published": "2023-10-31T15:15:09.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FOGProject"], "productName": ["fogproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-cvf7-7mvq-5694"], "commits": ["https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/2e2421f19620669b9930f72fb73a8dbc5efe4980"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 3148340, "JavaScript": 610300, "Shell": 240490, "Makefile": 91239, "SCSS": 79489, "Less": 78481, "CSS": 45725, "C": 19398, "HTML": 2693, "Awk": 375}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9626396?v=4", "stargazers": 1240, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
