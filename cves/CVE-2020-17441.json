The code for processing the IPv6 headers does not validate whether the IPv6 payload length field is equal to the actual size of the payload, which leads to an Out-of-Bounds read during the ICMPv6 checksum calculation, resulting in either Denial-of-Service or Information Disclosure. This affects pico_ipv6_extension_headers and pico_checksum_adder (in pico_ipv6.c and pico_frame.c)."], "published": "2020-12-11T23:15:13.213", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
