When an HTTP smuggling request with an ASCII control character is sent, it causes the Netty HttpObjectDecoder to transition into a BAD_MESSAGE state. As a result, any subsequent legitimate requests on the same connection are ignored, leading to client timeouts, which may impact systems using load balancers and expose them to risk."], "published": "2024-10-08T17:15:57.790", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
