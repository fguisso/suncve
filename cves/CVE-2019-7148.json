Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via crafted elf input, which leads to an out-of-memory exception.

By setting ASAN_OPTIONS=allocator_may_return_null=1 and running the reproducer, nothing happens.\""], "published": "2019-01-29T00:29:00.347", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
