An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix."], "published": "2025-02-10T22:15:38.450", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["netty"], "productName": ["netty"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-839f-4rhx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-839f-4rhx", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/netty/netty/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 21501220, "C": 441720, "HTML": 21029, "Shell": 18370, "JavaScript": 16232, "Dockerfile": 2422, "Makefile": 1814, "Groovy": 1755, "Ruby": 137, "CSS": 49}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/473791?v=4", "stargazers": 33967, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
