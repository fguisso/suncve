The library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter on which options are available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow. fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious user can construct a URL known  to not fetch successfully, then set the retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit ofetch options."], "published": "2023-12-09T00:15:07.653", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["johannschopplich"], "productName": ["nuxt-api-party"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party/security/advisories/GHSA-q6hx-3m4p-749h"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party/security/advisories/GHSA-q6hx-3m4p-749h", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["nuxt", "nuxt-auth", "nuxt-module", "nuxt-proxy"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 47747, "Vue": 8060, "JavaScript": 122}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27850750?v=4", "stargazers": 274, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
