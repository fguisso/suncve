Sensitive secrets such as passwords, token and API keys should be compared only using a constant-time comparison function. Untrusted input, sourced from a HTTP header, is compared directly with a secret. Since this comparison is not secure, an attacker can mount a side-channel timing attack to guess the password. As a workaround, this can be easily fixed using a constant time comparing function such as `crypto/subtle`'s `ConstantTimeCompare`. \n"], "published": "2023-05-30T04:15:09.980", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ginuerzh"], "productName": ["gost"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost/security/advisories/GHSA-qjrq-hm79-49ww"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dns", "go", "golang", "http2", "kcp", "obfs4", "quic", "shadowsocks", "sni", "socks5", "ssh", "tls", "tunnel", "tuntap", "udp"], "langs": {"Go": 602725, "Makefile": 3056, "Dockerfile": 469}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2801795?v=4", "stargazers": 16604, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
