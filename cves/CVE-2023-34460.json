The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the Filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Unix. Previously dotfiles were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented. Only Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected. The regression has been patched on version 1.4.1.\n\n"], "published": "2023-06-23T20:15:09.147", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tauri-apps"], "productName": ["tauri"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-wmff-grcw-jcfm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/066c09a6ea06f42f550d090715e06beb65cd5564"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["desktop-app", "high-performance", "mobile-app", "native-app", "rust", "web-frontend", "webview"], "langs": {"Rust": 2505293, "TypeScript": 215061, "NSIS": 109906, "Kotlin": 66526, "JavaScript": 50019, "Shell": 43350, "Swift": 22030, "Dockerfile": 2143, "HTML": 2143, "PowerShell": 1951, "AppleScript": 1828, "Svelte": 1725, "CSS": 1658, "Standard ML": 1348, "Ruby": 839, "Objective-C": 414, "Objective-C++": 100, "C++": 82}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54536011?v=4", "stargazers": 91208, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
