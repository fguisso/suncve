When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. This has been fixed in versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23 with improved documentation and deprecation of the functionality."], "published": "2020-08-06T23:15:11.577", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["etcd-io"], "productName": ["etcd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-wr2v-9rpq-c35q"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "consensus", "database", "distributed-database", "distributed-systems", "etcd", "go", "key-value", "kubernetes", "raft"], "langs": {"Go": 5605741, "Shell": 118681, "Jsonnet": 59378, "Makefile": 18076, "Procfile": 8727, "Dockerfile": 349}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41972792?v=4", "stargazers": 49039, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
