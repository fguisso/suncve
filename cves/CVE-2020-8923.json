Mitigation: update your Dart SDK to 2.7.2, and 2.8.0-dev.17.0 for the dev version. If you cannot update, we recommend you review the way you use the affected APIs, and pay special attention to cases where user-provided data is used to populate DOM nodes. Consider using Element.innerText or Node.text to populate DOM elements."], "published": "2020-03-26T12:15:12.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Google"], "productName": ["Dart SDK"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-hfq3-v9pv-p627"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dart", "language", "programming-language", "sdk"], "langs": {"Dart": 143348243, "C++": 23951080, "C": 1585723, "Python": 1291075, "HTML": 708923, "Java": 590347, "JavaScript": 278858, "Shell": 108936, "GAP": 97087, "CSS": 76022, "ANTLR": 48460, "TeX": 37865, "SCSS": 22311, "Makefile": 13103, "Assembly": 12274, "Batchfile": 4785, "CMake": 1598, "Objective-C++": 854, "Dockerfile": 499}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1609975?v=4", "stargazers": 10529, "language": "Dart"}}, "pocList": []}
