This is due to the use of a user supplied hashing algorithm passed to the hash_hmac() function and the use of a loose comparison on the hash which allows an attacker to trick the function into thinking it has a valid hash. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain administrator privileges."], "published": "2023-06-07T02:15:12.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wordable"], "productName": ["Wordable â€“ Export Google Docs to WordPress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
