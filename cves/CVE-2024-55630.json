Joplin's HTML sanitizer allows the `name` attribute to be specified. If `name` is set to the same value as an existing `document` property (e.g. `querySelector`), that property is replaced with the element. This vulnerability's only known impact is denial of service. The note viewer fails to refresh until closed and re-opened with a different note. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.8 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2025-02-07T23:15:13.293", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["laurent22"], "productName": ["joplin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5cch-jr52-qffh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/e70efcbd60ce62f06e77c183b362c74e636c02d9"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5cch-jr52-qffh", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android", "dropbox", "electron", "enex-files", "evernote", "javascript", "joplin", "nextcloud", "nodejs", "note-taking", "onedrive", "react-native", "synchronisation", "web-clipper", "webdav"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 8753011, "JavaScript": 2397835, "Rust": 425623, "HTML": 238245, "CSS": 134921, "Java": 126765, "Mustache": 75164, "Objective-C": 47291, "Handlebars": 31635, "Shell": 30055, "SCSS": 29088, "C++": 23817, "Kotlin": 15719, "Ruby": 4892, "Objective-C++": 3082, "CMake": 2456, "MDX": 1722, "Starlark": 1318, "C": 940, "Swift": 370, "Batchfile": 138}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1285584?v=4", "stargazers": 48595, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
