The application uses `random.randint` for this purpose, which is not suitable for cryptographic use and can be cracked. An attacker with access to workflow tools can extract the PRNG output and predict future password reset codes, leading to a complete compromise of the application."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:54.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["langgenius"], "productName": ["langgenius/dify"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
