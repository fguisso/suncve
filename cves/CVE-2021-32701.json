When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process."], "published": "2021-06-22T20:15:08.727", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ory"], "productName": ["oathkeeper"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/security/advisories/GHSA-qvp4-rpmr-xwrr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/1f9f625c1a49e134ae2299ee95b8cf158feec932"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api-gateway", "golang", "hacktoberfest", "oauth2", "openid-connect", "ory", "ory-oathkeeper", "reverse-proxy"], "langs": {"Go": 684583, "Mustache": 90778, "Shell": 21026, "Makefile": 3393}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25334553?v=4", "stargazers": 3332, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
