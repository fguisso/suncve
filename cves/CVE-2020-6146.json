When drawing the contents of a page and selecting the stroke color from an 'ICCBased' colorspace, the application will read a length from the file and use it as a loop sentinel when writing data into the member of an object. Due to the object member being a buffer of a static size allocated on the heap, this can result in a heap-based buffer overflow. A specially crafted document must be loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability."], "published": "2020-09-16T19:15:14.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Nitro Pro"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
