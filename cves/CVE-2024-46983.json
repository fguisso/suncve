The SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. This issue is fixed by an update to the blacklist, users can upgrade to sofahessian version 3.5.5 to avoid this issue. Users unable to upgrade may maintain a blacklist themselves in the directory `external/serialize.blacklist`."], "published": "2024-09-19T23:15:11.920", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sofastack"], "productName": ["sofa-hessian"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-hessian/security/advisories/GHSA-c459-2m73-67hj"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-hessian/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hessian", "security", "sofa-rpc", "sofastack"], "langs": {"Java": 1952335, "HTML": 3199, "Shell": 288}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36956638?v=4", "stargazers": 146, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
