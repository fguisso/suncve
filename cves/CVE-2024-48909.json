Starting in version 1.35.0 and prior to version 1.37.1, clients that have enabled `LookupResources2` and have caveats in the evaluation path for their requests can return a permissionship of `CONDITIONAL` with context marked as missing, even then the context was supplied. LookupResources2 is the new default in SpiceDB 1.37.0 and has been opt-in since SpiceDB 1.35.0. The bug is patched as part of SpiceDB 1.37.1. As a workaround, disable LookupResources2 via the `--enable-experimental-lookup-resources` flag by setting it to `false`."], "published": "2024-10-14T21:15:12.080", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["authzed"], "productName": ["spicedb"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-3c32-4hq9-6wgj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/2f3cf77a7fcfcb478ef5a480a245842c96ac8853"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["abac", "acl", "ciam", "cloud-native", "database", "distributed-systems", "entitlements", "fga", "fine-grained-access-control", "grpc", "kubernetes", "latency", "permissions", "production", "rbac", "rebac", "scale", "security", "security-tools", "zanzibar"], "langs": {"Go": 4944305, "JavaScript": 16612, "HTML": 3663, "Dockerfile": 1496}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73313589?v=4", "stargazers": 5527, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
