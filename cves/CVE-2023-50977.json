This DNS hijacking causes GNOME Captive Portal to be launched via a WebKitGTK browser, by default, on the victim system; this can run JavaScript code inside a sandbox. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is not a vulnerability because running JavaScript code inside a sandbox is the intended behavior."], "published": "2024-05-27T14:15:09.380", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
