Versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4 are subject to exposure of sensitive information to a malicious actor. When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`."], "published": "2022-10-19T11:15:11.227", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["git"], "productName": ["git"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/git/git/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "hacktoberfest", "shell"], "langs": {"C": 11479939, "Shell": 8677416, "Perl": 1166721, "Tcl": 855687, "Python": 183463, "Makefile": 172007, "Meson": 120576, "JavaScript": 49713, "CMake": 46812, "M4": 38265, "Roff": 26859, "C++": 26403, "SmPL": 15676, "Go": 15064, "CSS": 10664, "Batchfile": 9822, "Rust": 6798, "Emacs Lisp": 660, "PowerShell": 478, "ReScript": 92}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18133?v=4", "stargazers": 54138, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/ssst0n3/docker-cve-2022-39253-poc", "https://github.com/HiImDarwin/NetworkSecurityFinalProject", "https://github.com/ssst0n3/docker-cve-2022-39253-poc", "https://github.com/HiImDarwin/NetworkSecurityFinalProject"]}
