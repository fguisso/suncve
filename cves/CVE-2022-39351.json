Prior to version 4.6.0, performing an API request using a valid API key with insufficient permissions causes the API key to be written to Dependency-Track's audit log in clear text. Actors with access to the audit log can exploit this flaw to gain access to valid API keys. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.6.0. Instead of logging the entire API key, only the last 4 characters of the key will be logged. It is strongly recommended to check historic logs for occurrences of this behavior, and re-generating API keys in case of leakage."], "published": "2022-10-25T17:15:56.613", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["DependencyTrack"], "productName": ["dependency-track"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-gh7v-4hxp-gqp4"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["appsec", "bill-of-materials", "bom", "component-analysis", "cyclonedx", "devsecops", "hacktoberfest", "nvd", "ossindex", "owasp", "package-url", "purl", "sbom", "sca", "security", "security-automation", "software-composition-analysis", "software-security", "vulnerabilities", "vulnerability-detection"], "langs": {"Java": 5521355, "Dockerfile": 4100, "Shell": 3756, "HTML": 488}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40258585?v=4", "stargazers": 2959, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
