This vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality on the ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’ endpoint. When a file is uploaded via this resource, the server will create a temporary file that will be deleted after the client sends a POST request to ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’. This workflow is automated by the web client, however an attacker can trap and launch the second POST request to prevent the temporary file from being deleted."], "published": "2025-01-16T13:15:07.540", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PMB Services"], "productName": ["PMB platform"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
