A specially crafted file can result in an integer overflow when processing the directory from the file that allows for an out-of-bounds index to be used when reading and writing to an array. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-10-03T16:15:05.010", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["GNOME Project"], "productName": ["G Structured File Library (libgsf)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
