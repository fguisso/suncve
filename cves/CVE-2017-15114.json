As no additional authentication is configured this allows these services to connect to libvirtd (which is equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability exists in another service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate privileges to gain control over compute nodes."], "published": "2017-11-27T16:29:00.327", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
