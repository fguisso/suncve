Before 4.0.7, there is a flaw in the Static Libraries analysis section. Specifically, during the extraction of .a extension files, the measure intended to prevent Zip Slip attacks is improperly implemented. Since the implemented measure can be bypassed, the vulnerability allows an attacker to extract files to any desired location within the server running MobSF. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.7."], "published": "2024-08-19T15:15:09.073", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MobSF"], "productName": ["Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-4hh3-vj32-gr6j"], "commits": ["https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/cc625fe8430f3437a473e82aa2966d100a4dc883"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-4hh3-vj32-gr6j", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android-security", "api-testing", "apk", "cwe", "devsecops", "dynamic-analysis", "ios-security", "malware-analysis", "mastg", "masvs", "mobile-security", "mobsf", "mstg", "owasp", "rest", "runtime-security", "static-analysis", "web-security", "windows-mobile-security"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1582153, "Python": 1357612, "HTML": 1073644, "CSS": 148866, "Shell": 11552, "Batchfile": 4318, "PowerShell": 3089, "Dockerfile": 2909}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25052637?v=4", "stargazers": 18357, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
