An OS command injection vulnerability within the Fluid project's JuicefsRuntime can potentially allow an authenticated user, who has the authority to create or update the K8s CRD Dataset/JuicefsRuntime, to execute arbitrary OS commands within the juicefs related containers. This could lead to unauthorized access, modification or deletion of data. Users who're using versions < 0.9.3 with JuicefsRuntime should upgrade to v0.9.3."], "published": "2024-03-15T19:15:06.810", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluid-cloudnative"], "productName": ["fluid"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/security/advisories/GHSA-wx8q-4gm9-rj2g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/commit/e0184cff8790ad000c3e8943392c7f544fad7d66"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai-framework", "alluxio", "big-data", "data-abstraction", "distributed-cache", "kubernetes"], "langs": {"Go": 5962466, "Python": 166816, "Shell": 65767, "Mustache": 51447, "Makefile": 20128, "Smarty": 6238, "Dockerfile": 4603}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68415741?v=4", "stargazers": 1741, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
