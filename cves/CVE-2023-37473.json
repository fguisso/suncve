Passing _callable strings_ (ie `system`) caused the function to be executed. This would result in a limited subset of specific user input being executed as if it were code. This issue has been addressed in commit `f4b1c48820` and included in release version 0.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is not passed to either `EntityRepository::find()` or `query()`."], "published": "2023-07-14T21:15:09.047", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["zenstruck"], "productName": ["collection"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/security/advisories/GHSA-7xr2-8ff7-6fjq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/commit/f4b1c488206e1b1581b06fcd331686846f13f19c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 289576, "Twig": 2565}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/475780?v=4", "stargazers": 13, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
