Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-12-28T00:15:13.567", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["metersphere"], "productName": ["metersphere"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-vrv6-cg45-rmjj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/commit/d0f95b50737c941b29d507a4cc3545f2dc6ab121"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-vrv6-cg45-rmjj", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api-testing", "continuous-testing", "jmeter", "metersphere", "postman", "swagger", "test-automation", "testcase", "testing", "testlink", "testlink-alternative"], "langs": {"Java": 14779584, "Vue": 5726355, "TypeScript": 1961538, "MAXScript": 77425, "Less": 39452, "JavaScript": 34573, "CSS": 23345, "Dockerfile": 993, "HTML": 538, "Shell": 181}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56869043?v=4", "stargazers": 11931, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
