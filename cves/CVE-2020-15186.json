As a result, a malicious plugin author could use characters in a plugin name that would result in unexpected behavior, such as duplicating the name of another plugin or spoofing the output to `helm --help`. This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2. A possible workaround is to not install untrusted Helm plugins. Examine the `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for a plugin, looking for characters outside of the [a-zA-Z0-9._-] range."], "published": "2020-09-17T22:15:12.520", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["helm"], "productName": ["helm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-m54r-vrmv-hw33"], "commits": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/809e2d999e2c33e20e77f6bff30652d79c287542"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/helm/helm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["chart", "charts", "cncf", "helm", "kubernetes"], "langs": {"Go": 2008774, "Shell": 30899, "Makefile": 8750}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15859888?v=4", "stargazers": 27695, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
