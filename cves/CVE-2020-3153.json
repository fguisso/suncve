The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of directory paths. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious file and copying the file to a system directory. An exploit could allow the attacker to copy malicious files to arbitrary locations with system level privileges. This could include DLL pre-loading, DLL hijacking, and other related attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system."], "published": "2020-02-19T20:15:15.113", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/shubham0d/CVE-2020-3153", "https://github.com/raspberry-pie/CVE-2020-3153", "https://github.com/goichot/CVE-2020-3153", "https://github.com/shubham0d/CVE-2020-3153", "https://github.com/raspberry-pie/CVE-2020-3153", "https://github.com/goichot/CVE-2020-3153"]}
