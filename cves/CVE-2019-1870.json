The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information."], "published": "2019-06-05T17:29:00.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
