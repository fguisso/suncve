This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication and authorization scopes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS messages to the web services interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privilege level 15 access to the web management interface of the device. This includes privilege level 15 access to the device using management tools like the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) or the Cisco Security Manager (CSM). Note: With Cisco FTD Software, the impact is lower than the CVSS score suggests because the affected web management interface allows for read access only."], "published": "2022-05-03T04:15:09.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software "], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-gq88-gqmj-7v24"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-gq88-gqmj-7v24", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 3866, "Java": 873, "Makefile": 40}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48210684?v=4", "stargazers": 11, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
