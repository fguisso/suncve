This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-10-14T00:15:09.377", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Ree6-Applications"], "productName": ["Ree6"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Ree6-Applications/Ree6/security/advisories/GHSA-v574-xgcf-5w8x"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Ree6-Applications/Ree6/commit/459b5bc24f0ea27e50031f563373926e94b9aa0a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Ree6-Applications/Ree6/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bot", "discord", "discord-bot", "gpl3", "gplv3", "java", "jda", "jda-bot", "jda-discord-bot", "maven", "mee6", "moderation-bot", "music", "ree6", "soundcloud", "spotify", "twitch", "youtube"], "langs": {"Java": 1310089, "Dockerfile": 521}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94872631?v=4", "stargazers": 156, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
