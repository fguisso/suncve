This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the userâ€™s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer.
