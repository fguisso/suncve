An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input to an affected API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with low system privileges. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a user with Device permissions: by default, only Administrators, Security Approvers and Network Admins user accounts have these permissions."], "published": "2022-11-15T21:15:32.323", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Firepower Management Center"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
