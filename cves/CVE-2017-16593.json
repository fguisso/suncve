Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.restore.del_005fdo_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the filenames parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete any files accessible to the Administrator user.
