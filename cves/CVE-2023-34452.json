In versions 1.7.42 and prior, the \"/forgot_password\" page has a self-reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by injecting a script into the \"email\" parameter of the request. While this vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's browser, the impact is limited as it requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. As of time of publication, a patch is not available. Server-side validation should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-06-14T23:15:11.183", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["getgrav"], "productName": ["grav"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-xcr8-cc2j-62fc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-xcr8-cc2j-62fc", "kw": ["poc", "steps:", "payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "content", "content-management", "doctrine", "flat-file", "grav", "markdown", "php", "php7", "symfony", "twig", "website", "website-builder", "website-generation", "yaml"], "langs": {"PHP": 2927078, "CSS": 8627, "Twig": 1772, "JavaScript": 1393, "Logos": 908}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8237355?v=4", "stargazers": 14863, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
