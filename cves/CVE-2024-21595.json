A manual restart will be required to recover the device.\n\nThis issue only affects EX4100, EX4400, EX4600, QFX5000 Series devices.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  21.4R3 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4;\n  *  22.1R3 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S3;\n  *  22.2R2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S1;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2;\n  *  23.1 versions earlier than 23.1R2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "published": "2024-01-12T01:15:47.063", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
