The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to the affected software through crafted DHCP requests, and then persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information."], "published": "2019-10-16T19:15:11.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco SPA122 ATA with Router "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
