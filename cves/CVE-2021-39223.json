The Nextcloud Richdocuments application prior to versions 3.8.6 and 4.2.3 returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. (e.g. an attacker could see that the file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`). It is recommended that the Richdocuments application is upgraded to 3.8.6 or 4.2.3. As a workaround, disable the Richdocuments application in the app settings."], "published": "2021-10-25T22:15:07.507", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nextcloud"], "productName": ["security-advisories"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-rjcc-4cgj-6v93"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cve", "nextcloud", "security", "security-advisories"], "langs": {"PHP": 11445, "Hack": 1058}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19211038?v=4", "stargazers": 63, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
