A correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism. Due to an indexing error, part of the secret key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data. This results in an incorrect shared secret value being returned when the decapsulation function is called with a malformed ciphertext. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.12.0."], "published": "2024-12-06T16:15:22.637", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["open-quantum-safe"], "productName": ["liboqs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/cce1bfde4e52c524b087b9687020d283fbde0f24"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cryptography", "key-exchange-algorithms", "lattice-based-crypto", "post-quantum-cryptography"], "langs": {"C": 31261740, "Assembly": 13277343, "CMake": 403649, "Python": 170484, "C++": 38336, "Shell": 19758, "Cuda": 19141, "Nix": 2787}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4", "stargazers": 2158, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
