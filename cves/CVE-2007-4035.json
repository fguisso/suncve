NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of these issues, because physical collection can be used instead, because the vendor believes that relevant attackers typically do not corrupt an MBR or a filesystem, and because detection of a loop is valuable on its own."], "published": "2007-07-27T22:30:00.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
