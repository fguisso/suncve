The [`verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) workflow returns the list of files changed within a workflow execution. This could potentially allow filenames that contain special characters such as `;` which can be used by an attacker to take over the [GitHub Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) if the output value is used in a raw fashion (thus being directly replaced before execution) inside a `run` block. By running custom commands, an attacker may be able to steal secrets such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` if triggered on other events than `pull_request`.\n\nThis has been patched in versions [17](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17) and [17.0.0](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17.0.0) by enabling `safe_output` by default and returning filename paths escaping special characters for bash environments."], "published": "2023-12-29T17:16:07.560", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tj-actions"], "productName": ["verify-changed-files"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/security/advisories/GHSA-ghm2-rq8q-wrhc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/commit/498d3f316f501aa72485060e8c96fde7b2014f12", "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/commit/592e305da041c09a009afa4a43c97d889bed65c3"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/security/advisories/GHSA-ghm2-rq8q-wrhc", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["actions", "automation", "change-detection", "changed-file", "detects-files", "github", "github-actions", "release-automation", "verify", "workflow", "workflow-execution", "workflows"], "langs": {"Shell": 3983, "Python": 32}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67116787?v=4", "stargazers": 180, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
