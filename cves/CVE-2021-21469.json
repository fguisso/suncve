When no adequate protection has been enforced on any level (e.g., MDS Server password not set, network and OS configuration not properly secured, etc.), a malicious user might define UNC paths which could then be exploited to put the system at risk using a so-called SMB relay attack and obtain highly sensitive data, which leads to Information Disclosure."], "published": "2021-01-12T15:15:16.187", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["SAP SE"], "productName": ["SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
