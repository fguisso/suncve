In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19 and on the 2.x branch prior to 2.1.8, users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions. The likelihood of a user having create permissions but not having edit or delete permissions is low, but it is possible. Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch for the issue. Those who have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should update their implementations to respect permissions when the return value of `getCheckPermissions()` is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in their own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, should consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()` if the data is provided by users."], "published": "2024-01-23T14:15:37.967", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["silverstripe"], "productName": ["silverstripe-admin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-j3m6-gvm8-mhvw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1191095, "PHP": 269664, "SCSS": 243987, "CSS": 161724, "Gherkin": 84912, "HTML": 78917, "Scheme": 32274, "Less": 4175}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/379348?v=4", "stargazers": 26, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
