This is possible because of SWG incorrectly whitelisting authentication bypass methods and using a weak crypto password. This can lead to the attacker logging into the SWG admin interface, without valid credentials, as the super user with complete control over the SWG."], "published": "2022-07-27T10:15:08.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Skyhigh Security"], "productName": ["Skyhigh Secure Web Gateway (SWG)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
