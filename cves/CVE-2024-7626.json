This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php). This can also lead to the reading of arbitrary files that may contain sensitive information like wp-config.php."], "published": "2024-09-11T08:15:01.950", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wpdelicious"], "productName": ["WP Delicious – Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
