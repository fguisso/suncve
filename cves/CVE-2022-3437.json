The DES and Triple-DES decryption routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library allow a length-limited write buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a maliciously small packet. This flaw allows a remote user to send specially crafted malicious data to the application, possibly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack."], "published": "2023-01-12T15:15:10.083", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["samba"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
