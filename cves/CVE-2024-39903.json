A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in widgetti/solara, in version <1.35.1, which was fixed in version 1.35.1. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../' when serving static files. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system."], "published": "2024-07-12T15:15:11.177", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["widgetti"], "productName": ["solara"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/widgetti/solara/security/advisories/GHSA-9794-pc4r-438w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/widgetti/solara/commit/df2fd66a7f4e8ffd36e8678697a8a4f76760dc54"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/widgetti/solara/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dataapp", "fastapi", "flask", "ipywidgets", "jupyter", "starlette", "webapp"], "langs": {"Python": 1178695, "Vue": 126138, "CSS": 93997, "JavaScript": 34728, "Jinja": 26239, "TypeScript": 18475, "HTML": 10325, "Jupyter Notebook": 3758, "Shell": 2466, "Procfile": 1038}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99180851?v=4", "stargazers": 2010, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
