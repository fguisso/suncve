Prior to version 1.0.2, the two package search handlers, `Search` and `SearchFeed`, implemented in `pkg/app/handler/packages/search.go`, are affected by a SQL injection via the `q` parameter. As a result, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on `https://packages.gentoo.org/`. It was also demonstrated that primitive was enough to gain code execution in the context of the PostgreSQL container. The issue was addressed in commit `4fa6e4b619c0362728955b6ec56eab0e0cbf1e23y` of version 1.0.2 using prepared statements to interpolate user-controlled data in SQL queries."], "published": "2023-03-20T13:15:11.973", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gentoo"], "productName": ["soko"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gentoo/soko/security/advisories/GHSA-gc2x-86p3-mxg2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gentoo/soko/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"Go": 218802, "templ": 116870, "JavaScript": 10266, "SCSS": 9430, "Shell": 2216, "Dockerfile": 772}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52242?v=4", "stargazers": 7, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
