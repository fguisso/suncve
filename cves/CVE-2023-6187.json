This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This can be exploited if 2Checkout (deprecated since version 2.6) or PayPal Express is set as the payment method and a custom user field is added that is only visible at profile, and not visible at checkout according to its settings."], "published": "2023-11-18T02:15:49.333", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["strangerstudios"], "productName": ["Paid Memberships Pro â€“ Content Restriction, User Registration, & Paid Subscriptions"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
