This issue requires enabling the learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default, leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server with a normal HTTP request."], "published": "2024-07-08T22:15:02.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.8.6.redhat", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "OpenShift Serverless", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel for Quarkus", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel for Spring Boot 4", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel - HawtIO", "Red Hat build of Apicurio Registry", "Red Hat Build of Keycloak", "Red Hat build of OptaPlanner 8", "Red Hat build of Quarkus", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Fuse 7", "Red Hat Integration Camel K", "Red Hat Integration Camel Quarkus", "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack", "Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6", "Red Hat Process Automation 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7", "streams for Apache Kafka"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
