This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren't activated before being used (ie \"./venv/bin/python\") are not affected."], "published": "2024-10-22T17:15:06.697", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Python Software Foundation"], "productName": ["CPython"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e52095a0c1005a87eed2276af7a1f2f66e2b6483", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/633555735a023d3e4d92ba31da35b1205f9ecbd7", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8450b2482586857d689b6658f08de9c8179af7db", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9286ab3a107ea41bd3f3c3682ce2512692bdded8", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ae961ae94bf19c8f8c7fbea3d1c25cc55ce8ae97", "https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d48cc82ed25e26b02eb97c6263d95dcaa1e9111b"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/python/cpython/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 36258679, "C": 20933037, "C++": 465749, "M4": 259559, "HTML": 188474, "Batchfile": 78535, "Shell": 71242, "Roff": 49943, "Makefile": 36812, "Objective-C": 33055, "Common Lisp": 24579, "PLSQL": 22886, "PowerShell": 20323, "Rich Text Format": 6905, "JavaScript": 4489, "Kotlin": 3800, "Assembly": 2552, "DTrace": 2196, "CSS": 1325, "XSLT": 1174, "CMake": 419, "VBScript": 70}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525981?v=4", "stargazers": 66147, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
