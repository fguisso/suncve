Systems running registry versions 3.0.0-beta.1 through 3.0.0-rc.2 with token authentication enabled may be vulnerable to an issue in which token authentication allows an attacker to inject an untrusted signing key in a JSON web token (JWT). The issue lies in how the JSON web key (JWK) verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify that the actual key material matches. A fix for the issue is available at commit 5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd and expected to be a part of version 3.0.0-rc.3. There is no way to work around this issue without patching if the system requires token authentication."], "published": "2025-02-11T16:15:52.163", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["distribution"], "productName": ["distribution"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/distribution/distribution/security/advisories/GHSA-phw4-mc57-4hwc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/distribution/distribution/commit/5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/distribution/distribution/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "containers", "distribution", "oci", "oci-specification", "registry"], "langs": {"Go": 1498946, "Dockerfile": 7645, "Makefile": 7109, "Shell": 2838, "HCL": 2371}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78096003?v=4", "stargazers": 9431, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
