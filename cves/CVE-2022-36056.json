In versions prior to 1.12.0 a number of vulnerabilities have been found in cosign verify-blob, where Cosign would successfully verify an artifact when verification should have failed. First a cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify a blob even if the embedded rekorBundle does not reference the given signature. Second, when providing identity flags, the email and issuer of a certificate is not checked when verifying a Rekor bundle, and the GitHub Actions identity is never checked. Third, providing an invalid Rekor bundle without the experimental flag results in a successful verification. And fourth an invalid transparency log entry will result in immediate success for verification. Details and examples of these issues can be seen in the GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388 advisory linked. Users are advised to upgrade to 1.12.0. There are no known workarounds for these issues."], "published": "2022-09-14T20:15:09.860", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sigstore"], "productName": ["cosign"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388"], "commits": ["https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commit/80b79ed8b4d28ccbce3d279fd273606b5cddcc25"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 1582349, "Shell": 15353, "Makefile": 8782, "PowerShell": 1530}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71096353?v=4", "stargazers": 4826, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
