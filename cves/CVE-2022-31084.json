In versions prior to 8.0 There are cases where LAM instantiates objects from arbitrary classes. An attacker can inject the first constructor argument. This can lead to code execution if non-LAM classes are instantiated that execute code during object creation. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0."], "published": "2022-06-27T21:15:08.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["LDAPAccountManager"], "productName": ["lam"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-r387-grjx-qgvw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["duo", "group-management", "lam", "lam-packaging", "ldap", "ldap-management", "php", "user-management", "webauthn", "yubikey"], "langs": {"PHP": 3704039, "JavaScript": 3420778, "CSS": 277560, "HTML": 211913, "Shell": 36434, "Perl": 14941, "Makefile": 9207, "Dockerfile": 6545, "M4": 3653}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17960417?v=4", "stargazers": 443, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
