This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level permissions and above to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain would make it possible for attackers to execute code, retrieve sensitive data, delete files, etc.."], "published": "2022-11-21T13:15:10.273", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MuffinGroup"], "productName": ["Betheme"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
