Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which ends up calling into\n   shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account the blocks, we\n   shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. We return\n   -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated.\n2. Our caller detects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after\n   dropping the mmap_lock, and retries, calling back into\n   shmem_mfill_atomic_pte().\n3. Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used.\n4. So shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails to account blocks this time, and\n   immediately returns - without releasing the page.\n\nThis triggers a BUG_ON in our caller, which asserts that the page\nshould always be consumed, unless -ENOENT is returned.\n\nTo fix this, detect if we have such a \"dangling\" page when accounting\nfails, and if so, release it before returning."], "published": "2024-02-28T09:15:37.640", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
