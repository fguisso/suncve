Prior to version 9.0.1, when invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material. `@digitalbazaar/zcap` v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking. As a workaround, one may revoke a zcap at any time."], "published": "2024-04-10T22:15:07.340", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["digitalbazaar"], "productName": ["zcap"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/security/advisories/GHSA-hp8h-7x69-4wmv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/commit/261eea040109b6e25159c88d8ed49d3c37f8fcfe", "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/commit/55f8549c80124b85dfb0f3dcf83f2c63f42532e5"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 256411}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167436?v=4", "stargazers": 26, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
