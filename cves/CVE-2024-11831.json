The vulnerability occurs because the serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs, such as regex or other JavaScript object types, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This code could be executed when deserialized by a web browser, causing Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This issue is critical in environments where serialized data is sent to web clients, potentially compromising the security of the website or web application using this package."], "published": "2025-02-10T16:15:37.080", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security 4.4", "Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security 4.5", "Cryostat 3", "Logging Subsystem for Red Hat OpenShift", "Migration Toolkit for Applications 7", "Migration Toolkit for Virtualization", ".NET 6.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux", "OpenShift Lightspeed", "OpenShift Pipelines", "OpenShift Serverless", "OpenShift Service Mesh 2", "Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform 2", "Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2", "Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security 4", "Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel - HawtIO", "Red Hat build of Apicurio Registry", "Red Hat Build of Keycloak", "Red Hat build of OptaPlanner 8", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Developer Hub", "Red Hat Discovery", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Fuse 7", "Red Hat Integration Camel K", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack", "Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI)", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4", "Red Hat Openshift Data Foundation 4", "Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces", "Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing 3", "Red Hat Process Automation 7", "Red Hat Quay 3", "Red Hat Satellite 6", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7", "Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript/commit/f27d65d3de42affe2aac14607066c293891cec4e"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "json", "serialize", "web"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 34563}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16574?v=4", "stargazers": 2848, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
