This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the developer's Google API key. While this does not affect the security of sites using this plugin, it allows unauthenticated attackers to make requests using this API key with the potential of exhausting requests resulting in an inability to use the map functionality offered by the plugin."], "published": "2024-04-09T19:15:12.743", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wpgmaps"], "productName": ["WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
