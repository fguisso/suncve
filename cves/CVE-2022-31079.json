Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server reads the entire message into memory without imposing a limit on the size of this message. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large message to exhaust memory and cause a DoS. The Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server are under DoS attack in this case. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the CloudCore and EdgeCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected only when users enable `cloudStream` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and enable `edgeStream` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable cloudStream module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and disable edgeStream module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`."], "published": "2022-07-11T21:15:08.327", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kubeedge"], "productName": ["kubeedge"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-wrcr-x4qj-j543"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-native", "cncf", "container", "device-management", "docker", "edge-computing", "golang", "iot", "kubernetes", "mosquitto", "mqtt"], "langs": {"Go": 3878482, "Shell": 200453, "Makefile": 14265, "Dockerfile": 9882, "Mustache": 1288}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41812520?v=4", "stargazers": 6996, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
