This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."], "published": "2023-01-05T19:15:09.600", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["swiftylife"], "productName": ["Swifty Page Manager"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
