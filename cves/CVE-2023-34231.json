Prior to version 1.6.19, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Snowflake Golang driver via single sign-on (SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. A patch is available in version 1.6.19."], "published": "2023-06-08T20:15:09.483", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["snowflakedb"], "productName": ["gosnowflake"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/security/advisories/GHSA-fwv2-65wh-2w8c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/commit/e11a2a555f1b9f7adc1f01fb7b5e7f38fbbb2a1c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["golang", "snowflake"], "langs": {"Go": 1922656, "Shell": 9430, "Makefile": 5937, "Python": 3518, "Batchfile": 2522, "Dockerfile": 498}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6453780?v=4", "stargazers": 318, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
