In affected versions there is a bug in the heif input functionality of OpenImageIO. Specifically, in `HeifInput::seek_subimage()`.  In the worst case, this can lead to an information disclosure vulnerability, particularly for programs that directly use the `ImageInput` APIs. This bug has been addressed in commit `0a2dcb4c` which is included in the 2.5.13.1 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2024-07-15T20:15:05.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["AcademySoftwareFoundation"], "productName": ["OpenImageIO"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/security/advisories/GHSA-jjm9-9m4m-c8p2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/commit/0a2dcb4cf2c3fd4825a146cd3ad929d9d8305ce3"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/security/advisories/GHSA-jjm9-9m4m-c8p2", "kw": ["poc", "steps:", "reproduction steps"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c-plus-plus", "c-plus-plus-11", "image-processing", "images", "texture", "vfx"], "langs": {"C++": 7400157, "Python": 365878, "CMake": 280881, "Shell": 67818, "Makefile": 16235, "C": 12042}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40807682?v=4", "stargazers": 2063, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
