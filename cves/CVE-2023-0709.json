This allows authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute when the victim visits a a page containing the shortcode when the submission id is present in the query string. Note that getting the JavaScript to execute requires user interaction as the victim must visit a crafted link with the form entry id, but the script itself is stored in the site database."], "published": "2023-06-09T06:15:52.820", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["xpeedstudio"], "productName": ["Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder â€“ Flexible and Design-Friendly Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
