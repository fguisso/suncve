Running processes in container builds (e.g. Dockerfile RUN commands) can access environment variables from parent and grandparent processes. When run in a container in a CI/CD environment, environment variables may include sensitive information that was shared with the container in order to be used only by Buildah itself (e.g. container registry credentials)."], "published": "2022-03-03T19:15:08.107", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["buildah"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/containers/buildah/security/advisories/GHSA-7638-r9r3-rmjj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/a468ce0ffd347035d53ee0e26c205ef604097fb0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/containers/buildah/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["container", "container-image", "containers", "docker", "oci", "oci-image", "podman"], "langs": {"Go": 1660005, "Shell": 712503, "Dockerfile": 15324, "Perl": 10721, "Makefile": 9541, "Nix": 5816, "Roff": 1045, "Awk": 512, "Assembly": 431}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5874934?v=4", "stargazers": 7741, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
