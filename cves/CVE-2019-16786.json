According to the HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent with: \"Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\" would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0."], "published": "2019-12-20T23:15:11.277", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Pylons"], "productName": ["Waitress"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-g2xc-35jw-c63p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/f11093a6b3240fc26830b6111e826128af7771c3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["http-server", "python", "wsgi-server"], "langs": {"Python": 495249}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/452227?v=4", "stargazers": 1489, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
