In version 1.4.3, arbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `LoadFromFile`, which directly reads the file by obtaining the requested path `parameter[path]`. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue."], "published": "2023-08-10T18:15:11.043", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["1Panel-dev"], "productName": ["1Panel"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/security/advisories/GHSA-pv7q-v9mv-9mh5"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/security/advisories/GHSA-pv7q-v9mv-9mh5", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["1panel", "cockpit", "docker", "docker-ui", "lamp", "linux", "lnmp", "ollama", "webmin"], "langs": {"Go": 4291558, "Vue": 2630953, "Makefile": 923, "Shell": 674, "PHP": 482}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109613420?v=4", "stargazers": 26467, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
