An on-path attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting network traffic using a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to masquerade as a trusted host and monitor or change communications between the remote metrics service and the vulnerable client."], "published": "2025-01-08T16:15:38.357", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
