In affected versions `app/routes/v3/admin.controller.ts` did not correctly verify whether the user was an administrator (High Level) or moderator (Low Level) causing the request to continue processing. The response would be a 403 with ADMIN_ONLY, however, next() would call leading to any updates/changes in the route to process. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.49. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"], "published": "2023-08-14T21:15:13.797", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PrivateUploader"], "productName": ["PrivateUploader"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/PrivateUploader/PrivateUploader/security/advisories/GHSA-vhrw-2472-rrjx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/PrivateUploader/PrivateUploader/commit/869657d61e3c7a518177106fe63ea483082b0d3e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/PrivateUploader/PrivateUploader/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["chat", "cloud-server", "cloud-storage", "cloud-suite", "docker", "file", "private", "privateuploader", "self-hosted", "server", "sharenix", "sharex", "sharex-server", "sharex-uploader", "suite", "typescript", "upload", "uploader", "vue", "vuetify"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2043698, "Vue": 1666003, "CSS": 66881, "JavaScript": 38215, "HTML": 26628, "SCSS": 14560, "EJS": 1248, "Dockerfile": 288, "Shell": 221}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126652719?v=4", "stargazers": 32, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
