Affected versions of the link plugin and link UI component do not sanitize URLs to prevent use of the `javascript:` scheme. As a result, links with JavaScript URLs can be inserted into the Plate editor through various means, including opening or pasting malicious content. `@udecode/plate-link` 20.0.0 resolves this issue by introducing an `allowedSchemes` option to the link plugin, defaulting to `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`. URLs using a scheme that isn't in this list will not be rendered to the DOM. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade are advised to override the `LinkElement` and `PlateFloatingLink` components with implementations that explicitly check the URL scheme before rendering any anchor elements."], "published": "2023-06-09T18:15:09.813", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["udecode"], "productName": ["plate"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/udecode/plate/security/advisories/GHSA-4882-hxpr-hrvm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/udecode/plate/commit/93dd5712854660874900ae12e4d8e6ff28089eb7"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/udecode/plate/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "react", "shadcn-ui", "slate", "typescript", "wysiwyg"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5459287, "MDX": 1195897, "HTML": 415018, "JavaScript": 62934, "CSS": 60380, "Shell": 4232}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66228141?v=4", "stargazers": 13399, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
