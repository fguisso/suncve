In case of random generator failure, it could lead to a disclosure of 31 bits of uninitialized memory from the client to the server, and it also made easier to a malicious server to guess the client's nonce.Â \n\n"], "published": "2023-07-22T05:15:37.460", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PHP Group"], "productName": ["PHP"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-76gg-c692-v2mw"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-76gg-c692-v2mw", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/php/php-src/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 69336482, "PHP": 30211927, "C++": 588724, "M4": 409320, "Shell": 299560, "Lua": 272563, "Assembly": 236754, "JavaScript": 199518, "Lex": 99482, "Yacc": 92393, "Python": 34891, "Makefile": 33437, "Roff": 32151, "GAP": 23900, "GDB": 13663, "XSLT": 7963, "Awk": 2920, "Batchfile": 2219, "DTrace": 2180, "HTML": 1894}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25158?v=4", "stargazers": 38855, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
