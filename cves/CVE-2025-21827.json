This appears to be the lock for the USB interface\ndevice. The Mediatek btusb code gets called via this path:\n\n  Workqueue: hci0 hci_power_on [bluetooth]\n  Call trace:\n   usb_driver_claim_interface\n   btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf\n   btusb_mtk_setup\n   hci_dev_open_sync\n   hci_power_on\n   process_scheduled_works\n   worker_thread\n   kthread\n\nWith the above call trace the device lock hasn't been claimed. Claim\nit.\n\nWithout this fix, we'd sometimes see the error \"Failed to claim iso\ninterface\". Sometimes we'd even see worse errors, like a NULL pointer\ndereference (where `intf->dev.driver` was NULL) with a trace like:\n\n  Call trace:\n   usb_suspend_both\n   usb_runtime_suspend\n   __rpm_callback\n   rpm_suspend\n   pm_runtime_work\n   process_scheduled_works\n\nBoth errors appear to be fixed with the proper locking."], "published": "2025-03-06T16:15:54.967", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
