Prior to Git for Windows version 2.39.2, by carefully crafting DLL and putting into a subdirectory of a specific name living next to the Git for Windows installer, Windows can be tricked into side-loading said DLL. This potentially allows users with local write access to place malicious payloads in a location where automated upgrades might run the Git for Windows installer with elevation. Version 2.39.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Never leave untrusted files in the Downloads folder or its sub-folders before executing the Git for Windows installer, or move the installer into a different directory before executing it."], "published": "2023-02-14T21:15:12.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["git-for-windows"], "productName": ["git"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-p2x9-prp4-8gvq", "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gf48-x3vr-j5c3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"C": 12020956, "Shell": 8680483, "Perl": 1112312, "Tcl": 857873, "Python": 183463, "Makefile": 174034, "Meson": 120604, "C++": 116083, "JavaScript": 49713, "CMake": 48147, "M4": 38265, "Roff": 26859, "SmPL": 15676, "Go": 15064, "Batchfile": 11440, "CSS": 10664, "Rust": 6798, "Emacs Lisp": 660, "PowerShell": 478, "ReScript": 92}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4571183?v=4", "stargazers": 8618, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
