A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command."], "published": "2021-07-21T21:15:07.670", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["redis"], "productName": ["redis"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-8wxq-j7rp-g8wj"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/redis/redis/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cache", "database", "key-value", "message-broker", "nosql", "redis"], "langs": {"C": 7375634, "Tcl": 2458884, "Python": 149631, "Makefile": 28225, "Shell": 23638, "Ruby": 23260, "C++": 5987, "Smarty": 1047, "JavaScript": 953}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529926?v=4", "stargazers": 68587, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
