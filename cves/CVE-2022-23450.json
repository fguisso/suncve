The affected system allows remote users to send maliciously crafted objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized object. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with SYSTEM privileges."], "published": "2022-04-12T09:15:14.357", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Siemens"], "productName": ["SIMATIC Energy Manager Basic", "SIMATIC Energy Manager PRO"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
