This is due to insecure authentication based on an arbitrary transient name in the 'AutoLogin::listen()' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in an existing user on the site, even an administrator. Note: this vulnerability requires using a transient name and value from another software, so the plugin is not inherently vulnerable on it's own."], "published": "2025-02-27T08:15:31.130", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pluginly"], "productName": ["1 click passwordless login, temporary login, social login & user switching â€“ Login Me Now"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
