In versions prior to commit `08d33cfd8` an unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack. The “data-export” endpoint is used to export files using the filename parameter as user input. The endpoint takes the user input, filters it to avoid directory traversal attacks, fetches the file from the server, and afterwards deletes it. An attacker can trick the input filter mechanism to point to the current directory, and while attempting to delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper around it. Moreover, the endpoint is public and does not require any form of authentication, resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of Service issue, which crashes the instance using a single HTTP packet. This issue has been addressed in commit `08d33cfd8`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-01-19T01:15:09.123", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Mintplex-Labs"], "productName": ["anything-llm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/security/advisories/GHSA-xmj6-g32r-fc5q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/commit/08d33cfd8fc47c5052b6ea29597c964a9da641e2"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/security/advisories/GHSA-xmj6-g32r-fc5q", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["agent-framework-javascript", "ai-agents", "crewai", "custom-ai-agents", "deepseek", "deepseek-r1", "llama3", "llm", "lmstudio", "local-llm", "localai", "mcp", "mcp-servers", "multimodal", "ollama", "rag", "vector-database", "webui"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3589398, "CSS": 74448, "Dockerfile": 9300, "HTML": 3904, "Shell": 1382, "HCL": 1211}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134426827?v=4", "stargazers": 42341, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
