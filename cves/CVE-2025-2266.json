This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site."], "published": "2025-03-29T07:15:18.247", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mestresdowp"], "productName": ["Checkout Mestres do WP for WooCommerce"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Nxploited/CVE-2025-2266", "https://github.com/Nxploited/CVE-2025-2266"]}
