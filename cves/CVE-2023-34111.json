Attackers can inject malicious commands which will be executed by the workflow. This happens because `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}` is directly passed to bash command on like 25 of the workflow. This may allow an attacker to gain access to secrets which the github action has access to or to otherwise make use of the compute resources."], "published": "2023-06-06T17:15:15.210", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["taosdata"], "productName": ["grafanaplugin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/taosdata/grafanaplugin/security/advisories/GHSA-23wp-p848-hcgr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/taosdata/grafanaplugin/security/advisories/GHSA-23wp-p848-hcgr", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/taosdata/grafanaplugin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 70239, "Python": 41868, "Go": 35796, "Shell": 27952, "JavaScript": 4180, "Dockerfile": 2947, "CSS": 863}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48876650?v=4", "stargazers": 64, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
