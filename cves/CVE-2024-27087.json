The new link field introduced in Kirby 4 allows several different link types that each validate the entered link to the relevant URL format. It also includes a \"Custom\" link type for advanced use cases that don't fit any of the pre-defined link formats.  As the \"Custom\" link type is meant to be flexible, it also allows the javascript: URL scheme. In some use cases this can be intended, but it can also be misused by attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is generated from the contents of the link field. This vulnerability is patched in 4.1.1.\n\n"], "published": "2024-02-26T17:15:10.783", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["getkirby"], "productName": ["kirby"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-63h4-w25c-3qv4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/cda3dd9a15228d35e62ff86cfa87a67e7c687437"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "cms-framework", "content-management", "file-based", "flat-file", "flat-file-cms", "headless-cms", "kirby", "php8"], "langs": {"PHP": 4640023, "Vue": 997136, "JavaScript": 426813, "CSS": 33910, "HTML": 11552, "Shell": 1881, "Hack": 901}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28547180?v=4", "stargazers": 1370, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
