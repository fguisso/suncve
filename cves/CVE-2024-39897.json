Prior to 2.1.0, the cache driver `GetBlob()` allows read access to any blob without access control check. If a Zot `accessControl` policy allows users read access to some repositories but restricts read access to other repositories and `dedupe` is enabled (it is enabled by default), then an attacker who knows the name of an image and the digest of a blob (that they do not have read access to), they may maliciously read it via a second repository they do have read access to. \n This attack is possible because [`ImageStore.CheckBlob()` calls `checkCacheBlob()`](https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/v2.1.0-rc2/pkg/storage/imagestore/imagestore.go#L1158-L1159) to find the blob a global cache by searching for the digest. If it is found, it is copied to the user requested repository with `copyBlob()`. The attack may be mitigated by configuring \"dedupe\": false in the \"storage\" settings. The vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0."], "published": "2024-07-09T19:15:12.953", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["project-zot"], "productName": ["zot"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/project-zot/zot/security/advisories/GHSA-55r9-5mx9-qq7r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/project-zot/zot/commit/aaee0220e46bdadd12115ac67c19f9d3153eb1df"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/project-zot/zot/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["distribution-spec", "helm", "kubernetes", "oci", "oci-distribution", "opencontainers", "zot"], "langs": {"Go": 4252615, "Shell": 221861, "Makefile": 25958, "Dockerfile": 1187, "Java": 109}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93798821?v=4", "stargazers": 1171, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
