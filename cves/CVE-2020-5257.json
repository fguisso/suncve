This could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the `direction` parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections. Whilst this does have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the Administrate dashboards, which we would expect to be behind authentication. This is patched in wersion 0.13.0."], "published": "2020-03-13T21:15:12.190", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["thoughtbot"], "productName": ["administrate"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/security/advisories/GHSA-2p5p-m353-833w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/commit/3ab838b83c5f565fba50e0c6f66fe4517f98eed3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admin-dashboard", "rails", "ruby"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1242405, "Ruby": 401337, "HTML": 93493, "SCSS": 23495, "Shell": 4882, "CSS": 952, "Procfile": 40}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6183?v=4", "stargazers": 5937, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
