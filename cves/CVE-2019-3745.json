This issue is exploitable only during the installation of the product by an administrator. A local authenticated low privileged user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by staging a malicious DLL in the search path of the installer prior to its execution by a local administrator. This would cause loading of the malicious DLL, which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator."], "published": "2019-10-07T19:15:11.047", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Dell"], "productName": ["Dell Encryption Enterprise ", "Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
