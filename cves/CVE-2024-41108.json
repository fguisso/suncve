This data can only be retrieved if a task is pending on that host.Â Otherwise, an error message containing \"Invalid tasking!\" will be returned. The domainpassword in the hostinfo dump is hidden even to authenticated users, as it is displayed as a row of asterisks when navigating to the host's Active Directory settings.
