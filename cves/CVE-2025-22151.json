Starting in 0.182.0 and prior to version 0.257.0, a type confusion vulnerability exists in Strawberry GraphQL's relay integration that affects multiple ORM integrations (Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). The vulnerability occurs when multiple GraphQL types are mapped to the same underlying model while using the relay node interface. When querying for a specific type using the global node field (e.g., FruitType:some-id), the resolver may incorrectly return an instance of a different type mapped to the same model (e.g., SpecialFruitType). This can lead to information disclosure if the alternate type exposes sensitive fields and potential privilege escalation if the alternate type contains data intended for restricted access. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.257.0."], "published": "2025-01-09T19:15:20.410", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["strawberry-graphql"], "productName": ["strawberry"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/security/advisories/GHSA-5xh2-23cc-5jc6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/commit/526eb82b70451c0e59d5a71ae9b7396f59974bd8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asgi", "asyncio", "django", "fastapi", "graphql", "graphql-library", "graphql-schema", "graphql-server", "hacktoberfest", "mypy", "python", "starlette", "strawberry"], "langs": {"Python": 2302557, "HTML": 6777, "TypeScript": 6577, "Dockerfile": 517, "Shell": 74}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48071860?v=4", "stargazers": 4223, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
