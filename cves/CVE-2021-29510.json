In affected versions passing either `'infinity'`, `'inf'` or `float('inf')` (or their negatives) to `datetime` or `date` fields causes validation to run forever with 100% CPU usage (on one CPU). Pydantic has been patched with fixes available in the following versions: v1.8.2, v1.7.4, v1.6.2. All these versions are available on pypi(https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/#history), and will be available on conda-forge(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydantic) soon. See the changelog(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for details. If you absolutely can't upgrade, you can work around this risk using a validator(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/) to catch these values. This is not an ideal solution (in particular you'll need a slightly different function for datetimes), instead of a hack like this you should upgrade pydantic. If you are not using v1.8.x, v1.7.x or v1.6.x and are unable to upgrade to a fixed version of pydantic, please create an issue at https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues requesting a back-port, and we will endeavour to release a patch for earlier versions of pydantic."], "published": "2021-05-13T19:15:08.023", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["samuelcolvin"], "productName": ["pydantic"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-5jqp-qgf6-3pvh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/commit/7e83fdd2563ffac081db7ecdf1affa65ef38c468"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hints", "json-schema", "parsing", "pydantic", "python", "python310", "python311", "python312", "python37", "python38", "python39", "validation"], "langs": {"Python": 3664680, "Makefile": 4746, "Shell": 1851}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110818415?v=4", "stargazers": 23159, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
