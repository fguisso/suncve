Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0, helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0, and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-tenancy deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions. Workarounds include disabling functionality via Validating Admission webhooks by restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig` field in Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the controllerâ€™s pod to limit what binaries can be executed. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.23.0 and helm-controller v0.19.0, both included in flux2 v0.29.0"], "published": "2022-05-06T00:15:07.637", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluxcd"], "productName": ["flux2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-vvmq-fwmg-2gjc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["continuous-delivery", "gitops", "gitops-toolkit", "helm", "kubernetes", "kustomize"], "langs": {"Go": 1070721, "HCL": 9334, "Shell": 7615, "Makefile": 4535, "Dockerfile": 504}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52158677?v=4", "stargazers": 6964, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
