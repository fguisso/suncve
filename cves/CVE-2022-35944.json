This vulnerability only affects installations that rely on the safe mode restriction, commonly used when providing public access to the admin panel. Assuming an attacker has access to the admin panel and permission to open the \"Editor\" section, they can bypass the Safe Mode (`cms.safe_mode`) restriction to introduce new PHP code in a CMS template using a specially crafted request. The issue has been patched in versions 2.2.34 and 3.0.66."], "published": "2022-10-13T22:15:10.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["octobercms"], "productName": ["october"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-x4q7-m6fp-4v9v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["backend", "cmf", "cms", "cms-platform", "framework", "laravel", "octobercms", "php", "platform"], "langs": {"PHP": 2058359, "HTML": 84434, "CSS": 58023, "JavaScript": 22950, "Hack": 1770}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5554805?v=4", "stargazers": 11090, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
