CarrierWave has a Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS. The validation in `allowlisted_content_type?` determines Content-Type permissions by performing a partial match. If the `content_type` argument of `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed a value crafted by the attacker, Content-Types not included in the `content_type_allowlist` will be allowed. This issue has been patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.0.5."], "published": "2023-11-29T15:15:08.900", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["carrierwaveuploader"], "productName": ["carrierwave"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-gxhx-g4fq-49hj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/39b282db5c1303899b3d3381ce8a837840f983b5", "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/863d425c76eba12c3294227b39018f6b2dccbbf3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 601718, "Gherkin": 30231, "HTML": 1517}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3982589?v=4", "stargazers": 8783, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
