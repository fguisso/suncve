An attacker who generates a large number of sub-folders can consume memory on the system running node-tar and even crash the Node.js client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside. Version 6.2.1 fixes this issue by preventing extraction in excessively deep sub-folders."], "published": "2024-03-21T23:15:10.910", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["isaacs"], "productName": ["node-tar"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-f5x3-32g6-xq36"], "commits": ["https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/fe8cd57da5686f8695415414bda49206a545f7f7"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-f5x3-32g6-xq36", "kw": ["proof of concept", "steps to reproduce", "exploit:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["npm-cli"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 271712, "TypeScript": 211914}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9287?v=4", "stargazers": 860, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
