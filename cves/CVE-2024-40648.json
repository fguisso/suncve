The `UserIdentity::is_verified()` method in the matrix-sdk-crypto crate before version 0.7.2 doesn't take into account the verification status of the user's own identity while performing the check and may as a result return a value contrary to what is implied by its name and documentation. If the method is used to decide whether to perform sensitive operations towards a user identity, a malicious homeserver could manipulate the outcome in order to make the identity appear trusted. This is not a typical usage of the method, which lowers the impact. The method itself is not used inside the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate. The 0.7.2 release of the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate includes a fix. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-07-18T17:15:05.427", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-rust-sdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-4qg4-cvh2-crgg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/76a7052149bb8f722df12da915b3a06d19a6695a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["matrix-org", "rust", "sdk"], "langs": {"Rust": 10133711, "Shell": 5632, "Swift": 3872, "Python": 2588, "Ruby": 2075, "Perl": 782, "Makefile": 288, "Dockerfile": 125}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 1405, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
