Affected versions of HumHub are vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, the attacker would need a permission to administer the Spaces feature. The names of individual \"spaces\" are not properly escaped and so an attacker with sufficient privilege could insert malicious javascript into a space name and exploit system users who visit that space. It is recommended that the HumHub is upgraded to 1.11.4, 1.10.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-07-07T18:15:09.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["humhub"], "productName": ["humhub"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/humhub/humhub/security/advisories/GHSA-p7h3-73v7-959c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/humhub/humhub/commit/07d9f8f9b6334970ee38156a3416c3708d157cae", "https://github.com/humhub/humhub/commit/f88991dfe56a05870df165ac89a2755dd4c1ffa1"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/humhub/humhub/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["awesome", "enterprise-social-networks", "humhub", "ldap", "php", "social-network", "social-networking", "social-networks", "yii2"], "langs": {"PHP": 13133749, "JavaScript": 541189, "CSS": 240467, "Less": 166068, "HTML": 7117, "Batchfile": 1030, "Hack": 461}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6262639?v=4", "stargazers": 6416, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
