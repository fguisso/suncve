In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options."], "published": "2021-06-16T19:15:38.830", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-appservice-bridge"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/security/advisories/GHSA-35g4-qx3c-vjhx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/commit/b69e745584a34fcfd858df33e4631e420da07b9f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bridge", "library", "matrix", "nodejs"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 412719, "JavaScript": 138053, "Shell": 3563}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 166, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
