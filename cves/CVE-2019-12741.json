The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output in a form page, allowing attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information from ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java via a specially crafted URL. (This module is not generally used in production systems so the attack surface is expected to be low, but affected systems are recommended to upgrade immediately.)"], "published": "2019-06-05T15:29:01.873", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/commit/8f41159eb147eeb964cad68b28eff97acac6ea9a"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 33957544, "HTML": 271536, "Ruby": 230677, "Shell": 46167, "JavaScript": 31285, "CSS": 11084, "Kotlin": 3872, "Batchfile": 3861}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465117?v=4", "stargazers": 6, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
