This vulnerability requires a valid Google KMS configuration file to be exploitable. Specifically, by setting the `UI_LOGO_PATH` variable to a remote server address in the `get_image` function, an attacker can write a malicious Google KMS configuration file to the `cached_logo.jpg` file. This file can then be used to execute arbitrary code by assigning malicious code to the `SAVE_CONFIG_TO_DB` environment variable, leading to full system control. The vulnerability is contingent upon the use of the Google KMS feature."], "published": "2024-06-06T18:15:18.577", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["berriai"], "productName": ["berriai/litellm"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
