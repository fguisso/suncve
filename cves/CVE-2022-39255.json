Prior to version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround. To avoid malicious backup attacks, one should not verify one's new logins using emoji/QR verifications methods until patched."], "published": "2022-09-28T21:15:13.817", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-ios-sdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-hw6g-j8v6-9hcm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/commit/5ca86c328a5faaab429c240551cb9ca8f0f6262c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Objective-C": 4660528, "Swift": 1648756, "C": 13782, "Ruby": 7523, "Python": 7499, "Shell": 3767, "Jinja": 2085}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 459, "language": "Objective-C"}}, "pocList": []}
