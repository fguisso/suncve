Prior to versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0, ruby-saml is susceptible to remote Denial of Service (DoS) with compressed SAML responses. ruby-saml uses zlib to decompress SAML responses in case they're compressed. It is possible to bypass the message size check with a compressed assertion since the message size is checked before inflation and not after. This issue may lead to remote Denial of Service (DoS). Versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 fix the issue."], "published": "2025-03-12T21:15:42.363", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["SAML-Toolkits"], "productName": ["ruby-saml"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-92rq-c8cf-prrq", "https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-hw46-3hmr-x9xv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/acac9e9cc0b9a507882c614f25d41f8b47be349a", "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/e2da4c6dae7dc01a4d9cd221395140a67e2b3eb1"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 558976}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116213842?v=4", "stargazers": 944, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
