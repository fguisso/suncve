In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql\nvariable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable."], "published": "2024-01-31T23:15:08.337", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["WillyXJ"], "productName": ["facileManager"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/security/advisories/GHSA-xw34-8pj6-75gc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/commit/0aa850d4b518f10143a4c675142b15caa5872877"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/security/advisories/GHSA-xw34-8pj6-75gc", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 3062197, "CSS": 96827}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1309591?v=4", "stargazers": 90, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
