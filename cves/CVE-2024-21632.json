Prior to versions 2.0.0, the implementation did not validate the legitimacy of the `email` attribute of the user nor did it give/document an option to do so, making it susceptible to nOAuth misconfiguration in cases when the `email` is used as a trusted user identifier. This could lead to account takeover. Version 2.0.0 contains a fix for this issue.\n"], "published": "2024-01-02T22:15:10.103", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["synth"], "productName": ["omniauth-microsoft_graph"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/security/advisories/GHSA-5g66-628f-7cvj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/commit/f132078389612b797c872b45bd0e0b47382414c1"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 33492}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10546?v=4", "stargazers": 40, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
