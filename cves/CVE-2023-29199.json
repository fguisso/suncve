A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.16` of `vm2`.\n"], "published": "2023-04-14T19:15:09.337", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["patriksimek"], "productName": ["vm2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-xj72-wvfv-8985"], "commits": ["https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/24c724daa7c09f003e556d7cd1c7a8381cb985d7"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-xj72-wvfv-8985", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "node-js", "sandbox", "security", "vm"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 241704, "TypeScript": 7}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000058?v=4", "stargazers": 3902, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
