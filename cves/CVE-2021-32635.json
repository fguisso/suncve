In verions 3.7.2 and 3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected. Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote endpoint. The vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4. Two possible workarounds exist: Users can only interact with the default remote endpoint, or an installation can have an execution control list configured to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys."], "published": "2021-05-28T21:15:09.020", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sylabs"], "productName": ["singularity"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-5mv9-q7fq-9394"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["containers", "hpc", "linux"], "langs": {"Go": 3535294, "C": 82933, "Shell": 69370, "Makefile": 16208, "Awk": 15526, "Python": 4511, "Smarty": 886}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32401844?v=4", "stargazers": 830, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
