Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds."], "published": "2022-12-15T19:15:16.723", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["informalsystems"], "productName": ["tendermint-rs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-xqqc-c5gw-c5r5"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cometbft", "light-client", "rust", "tendermint"], "langs": {"Rust": 2176815, "TLA": 892642, "Shell": 11111, "JavaScript": 8339, "Dockerfile": 5141, "HTML": 3135, "Makefile": 751}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59101308?v=4", "stargazers": 637, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
