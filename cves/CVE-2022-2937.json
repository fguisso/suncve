This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, the plugin only allows administrators access to edit Image Hovers, however, if a site admin makes the plugin's features available to lower privileged users through the 'Who Can Edit?' setting then this can be exploited by those users."], "published": "2022-09-23T14:15:12.197", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["biplob018"], "productName": ["Image Hover Effects Ultimate"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
