An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing multiple wireless clients to attempt to connect to an access point (AP) on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reboot after a significant amount of time, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."], "published": "2023-09-27T18:15:11.493", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)", "Cisco Mobility Express"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
