A specially crafted XML cache file written to a specific location on the device can cause a stack buffer overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file. The destination buffer sp+0x440 is overflowed with the call to sprintf() for any subnetmask values that are greater than 1024-len(‘/etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=X1 state=enabled subnet-mask=‘) in length. A subnetmask value of length 0x3d9 will cause the service to crash."], "published": "2020-03-12T00:15:18.493", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Wago"], "productName": ["WAGO PFC200"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
