Starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.8.7 and 2.0.4, a malicious expression can use the transform operator to override properties on the `Object` constructor and prototype. This may lead to denial of service, remote code execution or other unexpected behavior in applications that evaluate user-provided JSONata expressions. This issue has been fixed in JSONata versions 1.8.7 and 2.0.4. Applications that evaluate user-provided expressions should update ASAP to prevent exploitation. As a workaround, one may apply the patch manually."], "published": "2024-03-06T20:15:47.537", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jsonata-js"], "productName": ["jsonata"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/security/advisories/GHSA-fqg8-vfv7-8fj8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/1d579dbe99c19fbe509f5ba2c6db7959b0d456d1", "https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/335d38f6278e96c908b24183f1c9c90afc8ae00c", "https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/c907b5e517bb718015fcbd993d742ba6202f2be2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 385085, "CSS": 1025, "HTML": 394}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22471344?v=4", "stargazers": 2247, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
