Releases prior to v2022-03-01 are subject to a denial of service attack via a crafted object causing a hash collision. This collision causes the server to spend at least quadratic time parsing it which can lead to a denial of service for a heavily used server. The issue has been fixed in wire-server 2022-03-01 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to 2022-03-01, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-04-13T19:15:08.990", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wireapp"], "productName": ["wire-server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-phxv-pffh-fq2r"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["haskell", "rust", "server", "wire"], "langs": {"Haskell": 12979975, "HTML": 2542469, "Nix": 364747, "Shell": 132309, "Python": 80630, "Smarty": 51681, "Rust": 48416, "Makefile": 47303, "Mustache": 16380, "C": 12943, "jq": 10188, "DIGITAL Command Language": 2530, "JavaScript": 1883, "Dockerfile": 1175}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16047324?v=4", "stargazers": 2666, "language": "Haskell"}}, "pocList": []}
