This condition can be triggered by calling sync.Pool.Put with the same *bytes.Buffer more than once, when request retries are enabled and a retry occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't had bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP request body from an unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current HTTP request body to it, sending two bodies in one request. The sync.Pool in question is defined at package level scope, so a completely unrelated server could receive the request body."], "published": "2023-11-28T17:15:08.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["github.com/go-resty/resty/v2"], "productName": ["github.com/go-resty/resty/v2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/go-resty/resty/commit/577fed8730d79f583eb48dfc81674164e1fc471e"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/go-resty/resty/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["backoff", "circuit-breaker", "curl-command", "digest-authentication", "go", "go-library", "go-resty", "golang", "golang-library", "hacktoberfest", "http-client", "http-trace", "load-balancer", "middleware", "redirects", "rest-client", "retry", "service-discovery", "srv-record", "sse-client"], "langs": {"Go": 518524, "Starlark": 2532}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14019737?v=4", "stargazers": 10730, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
