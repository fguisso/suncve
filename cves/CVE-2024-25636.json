Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2024-02-19T20:15:46.077", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["misskey-dev"], "productName": ["misskey"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-qqrm-9grj-6v32"], "commits": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/9a70ce8f5ea9df00001894809f5ce7bc69b14c8a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activitypub", "federation", "fediverse", "microblog", "misskey"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5814681, "Vue": 2650866, "JavaScript": 573863, "SCSS": 25333, "Pug": 21058, "CSS": 5402, "Dockerfile": 5117, "Shell": 1794, "Smarty": 1782, "HTML": 1243, "MDX": 575, "Procfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81036415?v=4", "stargazers": 10468, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
