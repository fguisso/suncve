Version 2.9.1 and prior are vulnerable to denial of service. â€‹The `checkUserPassword` method is used to check whether the password provided by the user matches the password saved in the database, and the `CodingUtil.md5` method is used to encrypt the original password with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text when it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password length."], "published": "2023-05-30T19:15:10.103", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["metersphere"], "productName": ["metersphere"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-qffq-8gf8-mhq7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/commit/c59e381d368990214813085a1a4877c5ef865411"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-qffq-8gf8-mhq7", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api-testing", "continuous-testing", "jmeter", "metersphere", "postman", "swagger", "test-automation", "testcase", "testing", "testlink", "testlink-alternative"], "langs": {"Java": 14779584, "Vue": 5726355, "TypeScript": 1961538, "MAXScript": 77425, "Less": 39452, "JavaScript": 34573, "CSS": 23345, "Dockerfile": 993, "HTML": 538, "Shell": 181}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56869043?v=4", "stargazers": 11931, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
