In the packages `aws-cdk-lib` 2.0.0 until 2.80.0 and `@aws-cdk/aws-eks` 1.57.0 until 1.202.0, `eks.Cluster` and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs create two roles, `CreationRole` and `default MastersRole`, that have an overly permissive trust policy. \n \nThe first, referred to as the `CreationRole`, is used by lambda handlers to create the cluster and deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest`, `HelmChart`, ...) onto it. Users with CDK version higher or equal to 1.62.0 (including v2 users) may be affected.\n \nThe second, referred to as the `default MastersRole`, is provisioned only if the `mastersRole` property isn't provided and has permissions to execute `kubectl` commands on the cluster. Users with CDK version higher or equal to 1.57.0 (including v2 users) may be affected.\n\nThe issue has been fixed in `@aws-cdk/aws-eks` v1.202.0 and `aws-cdk-lib` v2.80.0. These versions no longer use the account root principal. Instead, they restrict the trust policy to the specific roles of lambda handlers that need it. There is no workaround available for CreationRole. To avoid creating the `default MastersRole`, use the `mastersRole` property to explicitly provide a role."], "published": "2023-06-23T21:15:09.553", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aws"], "productName": ["aws-cdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/security/advisories/GHSA-rx28-r23p-2qc3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aws", "cloud-infrastructure", "hacktoberfest", "infrastructure-as-code", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 28502571, "JavaScript": 414317, "Python": 160488, "Shell": 65543, "Dockerfile": 10567, "Alloy": 6348, "Velocity Template Language": 2978, "Go": 1103, "C#": 501, "HTML": 378, "Ruby": 135, "Batchfile": 127}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2232217?v=4", "stargazers": 12062, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
