OpenProject utilizes `tablesorter` inside of the Cost Report feature. This dependency, when misconfigured, can lead to Stored XSS via `{icon}` substitution in table header values. This attack requires the permissions \"Edit work packages\" as well as \"Add attachments\". A project admin could attempt to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin. Otherwise, if a full System Admin is required, then this attack is significantly less impactful. By utilizing a ticket's attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 14.1.0, 14.0.2 and 13.4.2.\n"], "published": "2024-05-23T13:15:09.380", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["opf"], "productName": ["openproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-h26c-j8wg-frjc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["angular", "bcf", "boards", "bug-tracker", "gantt", "gantt-chart", "ifc", "issue-tracker", "kanban", "openproject", "project-management", "project-planning", "roadmap", "ruby", "scrum", "timeline", "workflows"], "langs": {"Ruby": 27773153, "TypeScript": 4615741, "HTML": 2723705, "Sass": 675223, "JavaScript": 115874, "Nix": 99153, "Shell": 91515, "SCSS": 14989, "API Blueprint": 13533, "CSS": 10185, "Perl": 9453, "Dockerfile": 8657, "Procfile": 132}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756674?v=4", "stargazers": 10287, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
