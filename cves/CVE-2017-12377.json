The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms in mew packet files sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a heap-based buffer over-read condition in mew.c when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected device."], "published": "2018-01-26T20:29:00.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
