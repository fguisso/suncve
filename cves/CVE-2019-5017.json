An unauthenticated, remote attacker can craft and send a packet containing an opcode that will trigger the kernel module to return several addresses. One of which can be used to calculate the dynamic base address of the module for further exploitation."], "published": "2019-06-17T21:15:09.877", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Talos"], "productName": ["KCodes"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
