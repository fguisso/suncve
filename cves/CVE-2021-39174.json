Prior to version 2.5.1, authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (User or Admin), can leak the value of any configuration entry of the dotenv file, e.g. the application secret (`APP_KEY`) and various passwords (email, database, etc). This issue was addressed in version 2.5.1 by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of nested variables in the resulting dotenv configuration file. As a workaround, only allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard."], "published": "2021-08-28T00:15:06.917", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fiveai"], "productName": ["Cachet"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/security/advisories/GHSA-88f9-7xxh-c688"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 3546924, "Blade": 238979, "JavaScript": 15477, "Vue": 13500, "Shell": 657}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22819349?v=4", "stargazers": 101, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/n0kovo/CVE-2021-39174-PoC", "https://github.com/hadrian3689/cachet_2.4.0-dev", "https://github.com/n0kovo/CVE-2021-39174-PoC", "https://github.com/hadrian3689/cachet_2.4.0-dev"]}
