When executing a relayed transaction, if the inner transaction failed, it would have increased the inner transaction's sender account nonce. This could have contributed to a limited DoS attack on a targeted account. The fix is a breaking change so a new flag `RelayedNonceFixEnableEpoch` was needed. This was a strict processing issue while validating blocks on a chain. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.4.17."], "published": "2023-07-13T19:15:09.263", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["multiversx"], "productName": ["mx-chain-go"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/security/advisories/GHSA-j494-7x2v-vvvp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/commit/babdb144f1316ab6176bf3dbd7d4621120414d43"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/security/advisories/GHSA-j494-7x2v-vvvp", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blockchain", "cryptocurrency", "decentralized", "go", "golang", "multiversx", "p2p"], "langs": {"Go": 20060841, "Shell": 82189, "Makefile": 3207, "Dockerfile": 3107}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114073177?v=4", "stargazers": 939, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/miguelc49/CVE-2023-34458-2", "https://github.com/miguelc49/CVE-2023-34458-1", "https://github.com/miguelc49/CVE-2023-34458-3", "https://github.com/miguelc49/CVE-2023-34458-2", "https://github.com/miguelc49/CVE-2023-34458-1", "https://github.com/miguelc49/CVE-2023-34458-3"]}
