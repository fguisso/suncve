This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, this can only be exploited by administrators, but the ability to use and configure WP Table Builder can be extended to contributors."], "published": "2024-05-21T10:15:11.023", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wptb"], "productName": ["WP Table Builder – WordPress Table Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
