A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions prior to 2024-04. This vulnerability is a combination of path traversal and arbitrary code execution, specifically targeting the `rspamd_maps()` function. It allows authenticated admin users to overwrite any file writable by the www-data user by exploiting improper path validation. The exploit chain can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server. Version 2024-04 contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2024-04-04T21:15:16.577", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mailcow"], "productName": ["mailcow-dockerized"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-4m8r-87gc-3vvp"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["acme", "clamav", "docker", "docker-compose", "dovecot", "groupware", "hacktoberfest", "imap", "mail", "mailcow", "mailserver", "olefy", "postfix", "rspamd", "servercow", "smtp", "sogo"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1412773, "PHP": 1224124, "Twig": 632398, "CSS": 353044, "Shell": 306299, "Python": 116967, "Lua": 37207, "Dockerfile": 21259, "Jinja": 15863, "Perl": 5763, "HTML": 5479, "Smarty": 5136, "Ruby": 943, "C++": 891, "BitBake": 732, "Sieve": 296}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23747925?v=4", "stargazers": 9997, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Alchemist3dot14/CVE-2024-30270-PoC", "https://github.com/Alchemist3dot14/CVE-2024-30270-PoC"]}
