Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:37.257", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mintplex-labs"], "productName": ["mintplex-labs/anything-llm"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/dd017c6cbbf42abdef7861a66558c53b66424d07"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["agent-framework-javascript", "ai-agents", "crewai", "custom-ai-agents", "deepseek", "deepseek-r1", "llama3", "llm", "lmstudio", "local-llm", "localai", "mcp", "mcp-servers", "multimodal", "ollama", "rag", "vector-database", "webui"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3589398, "CSS": 74448, "Dockerfile": 9300, "HTML": 3904, "Shell": 1382, "HCL": 1211}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134426827?v=4", "stargazers": 42340, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
