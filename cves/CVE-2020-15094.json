HttpCache uses internal headers like X-Body-Eval and X-Body-File to control the restoration of cached responses. The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by CachingHttpClient and if an attacker can control the response for a request being made by the CachingHttpClient, remote code execution is possible. This has been fixed in versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5."], "published": "2020-09-02T18:15:11.187", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["symfony"], "productName": ["symfony"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-754h-5r27-7x3r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/d9910e0b33a2e0f993abff41c6fbc86951b66d78"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bundle", "framework", "hacktoberfest", "php", "php-framework", "symfony", "symfony-bundle"], "langs": {"PHP": 30987251, "Twig": 526600, "CSS": 56186, "JavaScript": 28225, "HTML": 16804, "Shell": 9654, "Makefile": 1612, "Hack": 26}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143937?v=4", "stargazers": 30255, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
