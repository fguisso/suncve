The pos array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If n_channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the pos array. The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This bug allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:32.363", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
