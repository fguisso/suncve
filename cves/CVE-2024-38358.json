If the preopened directory has a symlink pointing outside, WASI programs can traverse the symlink and access host filesystem if the caller sets both `oflags::creat` and `rights::fd_write`. Programs can also crash the runtime by creating a symlink pointing outside with `path_symlink` and `path_open`ing the link. This issue has been addressed in commit `b9483d022` which has been included in release version 4.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-06-19T20:15:11.990", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wasmerio"], "productName": ["wasmer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/security/advisories/GHSA-55f3-3qvg-8pv5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/commit/b9483d022c602b994103f78ecfe46f017f8ac662"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/security/advisories/GHSA-55f3-3qvg-8pv5", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["emscripten", "linux", "macos", "rust", "wasi", "wasix", "wasm", "wasmer", "webassembly", "windows"], "langs": {"Rust": 9711366, "C++": 204795, "HTML": 199645, "C": 196990, "Makefile": 41729, "Python": 31600, "Shell": 13323, "JavaScript": 5241, "Swift": 4867, "Nix": 4103, "Inno Setup": 3133, "Dockerfile": 320, "PHP": 310, "Batchfile": 30, "RenderScript": 3}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44205449?v=4", "stargazers": 19564, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
