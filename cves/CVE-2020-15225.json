In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. Version 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade."], "published": "2021-04-29T21:15:08.490", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["carltongibson"], "productName": ["django-filter"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/security/advisories/GHSA-x7gm-rfgv-w973"], "commits": ["https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/commit/340cf7a23a2b3dcd7183f6a0d6c383e85b130d2b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 361961, "HTML": 517, "Makefile": 145}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64686?v=4", "stargazers": 4556, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
