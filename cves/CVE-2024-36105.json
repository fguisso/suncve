Prior to versions 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1, Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `\"0.0.0.0\"`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `\"::\"`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.\n"], "published": "2024-05-27T18:15:10.613", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dbt-labs"], "productName": ["dbt-core"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/security/advisories/GHSA-pmrx-695r-4349"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/commit/0c08d7a19ad1740be3cb0b2e6d9d64f6537176f7"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/security/advisories/GHSA-pmrx-695r-4349", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["analytics", "business-intelligence", "data-modeling", "dbt-viewpoint", "elt", "pypa", "slack"], "langs": {"Python": 4891290, "HTML": 1709115, "Rust": 43990, "Shell": 7055, "Makefile": 5646, "Dockerfile": 1398, "Batchfile": 804}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18339788?v=4", "stargazers": 10608, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
