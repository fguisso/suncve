Users of the typed-rest-client library version 1.7.3 or lower are vulnerable to leak authentication data to 3rd parties. The flow of the vulnerability is as follows: First, send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`, `BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler`. Second, the target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to a second host. Third, the next request will use the credentials to authenticate with the second host, by setting the `Authorization` header. The expected behavior is that the next request will *NOT* set the `Authorization` header. The problem was fixed in version 1.8.0. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2023-04-26T21:15:09.380", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["microsoft"], "productName": ["typed-rest-client"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/security/advisories/GHSA-558p-m34m-vpmq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/commit/f9ff755631b982ee1303dfc3e3c823d0d31233e8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 148109, "JavaScript": 25273}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4", "stargazers": 677, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
