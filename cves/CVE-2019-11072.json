NOTE: The developer states \"The feature which can be abused to cause the crash is a new feature in lighttpd 1.4.50, and is not enabled by default. It must be explicitly configured in the config file (e.g. lighttpd.conf). Certain input will trigger an abort() in lighttpd when that feature is enabled. lighttpd detects the underflow or realloc() will fail (in both 32-bit and 64-bit executables), also detected in lighttpd. Either triggers an explicit abort() by lighttpd. This is not exploitable beyond triggering the explicit abort() with subsequent application exit.\""], "published": "2019-04-10T22:29:00.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/lighttpd/lighttpd1.4/commit/32120d5b8b3203fc21ccb9eafb0eaf824bb59354"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/lighttpd/lighttpd1.4/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 4198472, "C++": 268649, "Perl": 84115, "M4": 54844, "CMake": 45147, "Python": 34182, "Meson": 31835, "Yacc": 24068, "Makefile": 17691, "Shell": 16277, "HTML": 4365, "Ruby": 44}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/796438?v=4", "stargazers": 643, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
