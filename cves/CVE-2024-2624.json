The vulnerability arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input for the `path` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file system paths. This flaw enables direct arbitrary file uploads, leakage of `personal_data`, and overwriting of configurations in `lollms-webui`->`configs` by exploiting the same named directory in `personal_data`. The issue affects the latest version of the application and is fixed in version 9.4. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure, unauthorized file uploads, and potentially remote code execution by overwriting critical configuration files."], "published": "2024-06-06T19:15:55.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms-webui"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/aeba79f3ea934331b8ecd625a58bae6e4f7e7d3f"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "llm", "text-generation"], "langs": {"CSS": 3034388, "Vue": 1267094, "Python": 366554, "JavaScript": 194610, "Shell": 41865, "Batchfile": 30713, "Inno Setup": 27460, "HTML": 24508, "Jupyter Notebook": 3623, "Dockerfile": 1060}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827993?v=4", "stargazers": 4600, "language": "CSS"}}, "pocList": []}
