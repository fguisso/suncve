In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function. When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in release `32.5.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-08-14T20:15:12.837", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nexB"], "productName": ["scancode.io"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/security/advisories/GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/security/advisories/GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cyclonedx", "docker", "foss-compliance", "license", "open-source", "package-url", "purl", "sca", "scancode", "software-composition-analysis", "spdx", "virtual-machine", "vulnerabilities"], "langs": {"Python": 1853249, "HTML": 263309, "JavaScript": 42865, "CSS": 8835, "Makefile": 6307, "Dockerfile": 3543, "Java": 1009, "C++": 423}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95001295?v=4", "stargazers": 131, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
