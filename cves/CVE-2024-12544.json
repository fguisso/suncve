This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This function is still vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery as of 1.12.20."], "published": "2025-03-01T08:15:33.367", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["devsoftbaltic"], "productName": ["SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple forms of any complexity"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
