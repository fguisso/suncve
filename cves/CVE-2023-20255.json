A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial availability condition, which could cause ongoing video calls to be dropped due to the invalid packets reaching the Web Bridge."], "published": "2023-11-01T18:15:09.700", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Meeting Server"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
