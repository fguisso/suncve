This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the target systems Remote Desktop Service via RDP.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Remote Desktop Services handles connection requests.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:18.610", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows Server, version 1803  (Server Core Installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
