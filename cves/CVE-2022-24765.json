This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`."], "published": "2022-04-12T18:15:09.390", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["git-for-windows"], "productName": ["git"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"C": 12020956, "Shell": 8680483, "Perl": 1112312, "Tcl": 857873, "Python": 183463, "Makefile": 174034, "Meson": 120604, "C++": 116083, "JavaScript": 49713, "CMake": 48147, "M4": 38265, "Roff": 26859, "SmPL": 15676, "Go": 15064, "Batchfile": 11440, "CSS": 10664, "Rust": 6798, "Emacs Lisp": 660, "PowerShell": 478, "ReScript": 92}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4571183?v=4", "stargazers": 8618, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
