This is due to a lack of nonce validation and insufficient validation of the instance_id on the 'updraftmethod-googledrive-auth' action used to update Google Drive remote storage location. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Drive location that backups are sent to via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can make it possible for attackers to receive backups for a site which may contain sensitive information."], "published": "2023-11-07T21:15:14.193", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["davidanderson"], "productName": ["UpdraftPlus: WordPress Backup & Migration Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
