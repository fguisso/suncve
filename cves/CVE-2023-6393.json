When request processing utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult and the cached Uni reuses the initial \"completion\" context, the processing switches to the cached Uni instead of the request context. This is a problem if the cached Uni context contains sensitive information, and could allow a malicious user to benefit from a POST request returning the response that is meant for another user, gaining access to sensitive data."], "published": "2023-12-06T17:15:07.377", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat build of Quarkus 2.13.9.Final", "Red Hat build of Quarkus"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
