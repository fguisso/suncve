An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the userâ€™s system.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:19.033", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 7", "Windows 7 Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2008  Service Pack 2", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Systems Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1", "Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
