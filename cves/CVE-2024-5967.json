The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL  independently without re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. This flaw allows an attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) to change the LDAP host URL (\"Connection URL\") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain."], "published": "2024-06-18T12:15:12.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Build of Keycloak", "Red Hat build of Keycloak 22", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9", "RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
