An infinite loop was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when deleting the IPTC data, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-d I rm`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5."], "published": "2021-08-09T19:15:08.230", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Exiv2"], "productName": ["exiv2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-9jh3-fcc3-g6hv"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cli", "exif", "exif-interface", "exif-metadata", "image-metadata", "iptc", "iptc-metadata", "xmp", "xmp-metadata"], "langs": {"C++": 4300067, "Python": 937903, "CMake": 61321, "C": 35700, "Meson": 13772, "Shell": 8085, "Batchfile": 914, "CodeQL": 599, "QMake": 392, "sed": 370}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23559442?v=4", "stargazers": 995, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
