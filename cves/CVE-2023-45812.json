Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when a multi-part response is sent. When users send queries to the router that uses the `@defer` or Subscriptions, the Router will panic. To be vulnerable, users of Router must have a coprocessor with `coprocessor.supergraph.response` configured in their `router.yaml` and also to support either `@defer` or Subscriptions. Apollo Router version 1.33.0 has a fix for this vulnerability which was introduced in PR #4014. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using the coprocessor supergraph response or disable defer and subscriptions support and continue to use the coprocessor supergraph response."], "published": "2023-10-18T22:15:09.403", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["apollographql"], "productName": ["router"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-r344-xw3p-2frj"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["apollo", "federated-graph", "federation", "gateway", "gateway-api", "graph-router", "graphql"], "langs": {"Rust": 10333953, "TLA": 23302, "Shell": 14640, "HTML": 4884, "TypeScript": 4820, "Smarty": 3754, "Handlebars": 1847, "Dockerfile": 537}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17189275?v=4", "stargazers": 860, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
