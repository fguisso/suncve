However, if the uptodate flag is set on a folio/page, and the\nbuffer heads are detached from it by try_to_free_buffers(), and new buffer\nheads are then attached by create_empty_buffers(), the uptodate flag may\nbe restored to each buffer without the block device being set to\nbh->b_bdev, and mark_buffer_dirty() may be called later in that state,\nresulting in the bug mentioned above.\n\nFix this issue by making nilfs_grab_buffer() always set the block device\nof the super block structure to the buffer head, regardless of the state\nof the buffer's uptodate flag."], "published": "2024-12-04T15:15:12.927", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
