This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. It may also be possible to socially engineer an administrator into uploading a malicious folder import."], "published": "2024-02-05T22:16:04.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ninjateam"], "productName": ["FileBird â€“ WordPress Media Library Folders & File Manager"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
