The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint, where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder` parameters accepting empty strings (`\"\"`), which, due to inadequate input sanitization, can lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently, if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path, this path can be appended to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0, and has been addressed in version 9.8."], "published": "2024-06-22T17:15:34.410", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/commit/2d0c4e76be93195836ecd0948027e791b8a2626f"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 1449900, "Shell": 30804, "Batchfile": 16275, "HTML": 6350, "Jupyter Notebook": 4229, "C++": 3433, "Dockerfile": 957, "Makefile": 294}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827993?v=4", "stargazers": 288, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
