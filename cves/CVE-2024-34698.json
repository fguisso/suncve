Versions of FreeScout prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters Parsing), without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key `__proto__`, along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself. As a result, the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values, which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in an unsafe way, this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS, Open Redirection, Cookie Manipulation, Link Manipulation, HTML Injection, etc. Version 1.8.139 contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2024-05-14T15:39:27.840", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["freescout-helpdesk"], "productName": ["freescout"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-rx6j-4c33-9h3r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/commit/2614514bc6d6c4ad563202a1c9cae5a97b195cc5"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-rx6j-4c33-9h3r", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["customer-support", "help-desk", "helpdesk", "helpdesk-ticketing", "helpscout", "laravel", "osticket-alternative", "php", "shared-mailboxes", "support", "ticketing", "ticketing-system", "zendesk", "zendesk-alternative"], "langs": {"PHP": 4318644, "Blade": 449905, "Shell": 16079, "Vue": 563}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/152988407?v=4", "stargazers": 3388, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
