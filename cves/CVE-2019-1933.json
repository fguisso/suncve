The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain email fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email message to a recipient protected by the ESA. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured message filters and inject arbitrary scripting code inside the email body. The malicious code is not executed by default unless the recipient's email client is configured to execute scripts contained in emails."], "published": "2019-07-06T02:15:12.183", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
