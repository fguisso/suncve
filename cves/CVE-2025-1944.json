By modifying the filename in the ZIP header while keeping the original filename in the directory listing, an attacker can make PickleScan raise a BadZipFile error. However, PyTorch's more forgiving ZIP implementation still allows the model to be loaded, enabling malicious payloads to bypass detection."], "published": "2025-03-10T12:15:10.967", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mmaitre314"], "productName": ["picklescan"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mmaitre314/picklescan/security/advisories/GHSA-7q5r-7gvp-wc82"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mmaitre314/picklescan/commit/e58e45e0d9e091159c1554f9b04828bbb40b9781"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/mmaitre314/picklescan/security/advisories/GHSA-7q5r-7gvp-wc82", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/mmaitre314/picklescan/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 58407, "Pkl": 84}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8584604?v=4", "stargazers": 324, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
