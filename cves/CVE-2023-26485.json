A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `_` characters. This issue has been addressed in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should validate that their input comes from trusted sources. ### Impact A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. ### Proof of concept ``` $ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c 'pad = \"_\" * 100000; print(pad + \".\" + pad, end=\"\")' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext ``` Increasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase quadratically. ### Patches This vulnerability have been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.10. ### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm XXX: TBD [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) is a fork of [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over time, but share a common core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`. ### Credit We would like to thank @gravypod for reporting this vulnerability. ### References https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [github/cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)"], "published": "2023-03-31T23:15:07.250", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["github"], "productName": ["cmark-gfm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-r8vr-c48j-fcc5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/commit/07a66c9bc341f902878e37d7da8647d6ef150987"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-r8vr-c48j-fcc5", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 768727, "C++": 201370, "Python": 50409, "CMake": 22945, "XSLT": 11938, "Racket": 8625, "Makefile": 7169, "Shell": 899, "Dockerfile": 820, "Perl": 525, "Ruby": 316, "Batchfile": 294, "JavaScript": 102}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4", "stargazers": 953, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
