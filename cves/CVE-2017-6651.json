All releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server later than release 2.5MR4 provide this functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via an exposed parameter to search for indexed meeting information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain scheduled meeting information and potentially allow the attacker to attend scheduled, customer meetings. This vulnerability affects the following releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server: 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8.
