The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of the LLDP frame header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly."], "published": "2018-10-17T19:29:00.303", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software", "Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewalls "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
