The conversion surely is truncating the double into a long value, but there is no impact as the value is one of the RGB components.\""], "published": "2017-04-19T15:59:00.210", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
