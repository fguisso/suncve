This allows an attacker to instantiate arbitrary classes, passing parameters to their constructors and invoking setter methods. Depending on the installed dependencies, various types of attacks are possible, including the execution of arbitrary code, retrieval of sensitive information, and unauthorized access."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:32.603", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["yiisoft"], "productName": ["yiisoft/yii2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
