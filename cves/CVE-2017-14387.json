This NFS service contained a flaw that did not properly propagate changes made to the default security flavor to all new and existing NFS exports that are configured to use default NFS export settings and that are mounted after those changes are made. This flaw may potentially allow NFS clients to access affected NFS exports using the default and potentially weaker security flavor even if a more secure one was selected to be used by the OneFS administrator, aka an \"NFS Export Security Setting Fallback Vulnerability.\""], "published": "2017-12-20T23:29:00.297", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["EMC Isilon OneFS EMC Isilon OneFS 8.1.0.0, EMC Isilon OneFS 8.0.1.0 -- 8.0.1.1, EMC Isilon OneFS 8.0.0.0 8.0.0.4"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
