The server part of pupnp (libupnp) appears to be vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks because it does not check the value of the `Host` header. This can be mitigated by using DNS revolvers which block DNS-rebinding attacks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.14.6 and later."], "published": "2021-04-20T21:15:08.493", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pupnp"], "productName": ["pupnp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pupnp/pupnp/security/advisories/GHSA-6hqq-w3jq-9fhg"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pupnp/pupnp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "dlna", "library", "sdk", "ssdp", "upnp", "upnp-library", "xml"], "langs": {"C": 1659563, "M4": 72068, "CMake": 35480, "C++": 29323, "HTML": 20328, "Makefile": 8654, "Shell": 5017, "Python": 2125, "CSS": 1242, "QMake": 591, "JavaScript": 249}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58831064?v=4", "stargazers": 397, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
