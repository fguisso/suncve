An attacker can decrypt ciphertexts by exploiting the Marvin security flaw. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to a large number of ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.\r\r Workaround \r\rThe vulnerability can be mitigated by finding and replacing RSA and RSAOAEP decryption with another crypto library."], "published": "2024-01-22T05:15:08.720", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["jsrsasign", "org.webjars.npm:jsrsasign", "org.webjars.bowergithub.kjur:jsrsasign", "org.webjars.bower:jsrsasign"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
