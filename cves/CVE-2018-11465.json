A local attacker could use ioctl calls to do out of bounds reads, arbitrary writes, or execute code in kernel mode. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with local access to the affected systems. Successful exploitation requires user privileges but no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.
