Users hosting Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack that could leak data from their web server file-system such as: server logs, world readable files, and potentially other sensitive information. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of that file. This issue has been resolved in version 1.11.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-08-01T22:15:10.223", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["streamlit"], "productName": ["streamlit"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/security/advisories/GHSA-v4hr-4jpx-56gc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/commit/80d9979d5f4a00217743d607078a1d867fad8acf"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data-analysis", "data-science", "data-visualization", "deep-learning", "developer-tools", "machine-learning", "python", "streamlit"], "langs": {"Python": 5733456, "TypeScript": 3943666, "JavaScript": 66465, "HTML": 17078, "Makefile": 16890, "SCSS": 6463, "Shell": 3688, "Batchfile": 676}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45109972?v=4", "stargazers": 38634, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
