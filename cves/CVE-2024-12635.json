This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.2.0."], "published": "2024-12-21T07:15:09.380", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fahadmahmood"], "productName": ["WP Docs"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
