This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_save_folder function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link leading them to perform actions intended for administrators such as changing the folder structure maintained by the plugin."], "published": "2023-02-07T22:15:11.147", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wickedplugins"], "productName": ["Wicked Folders"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
