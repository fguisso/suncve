Users of calamares-nixos-extensions version 0.3.12 and prior who installed NixOS through the graphical calamares installer, with an unencrypted `/boot`, on either non-UEFI systems or with a LUKS partition different from `/` have their LUKS key file in `/boot` as a plaintext CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of version 0.3.13 to backport to NixOS 22.11, 23.05, and unstable channels. Expert users who have a copy of their data may, as a workaround, re-encrypt the LUKS partition(s) themselves."], "published": "2023-06-29T01:15:51.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["NixOS"], "productName": ["calamares-nixos-extensions"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vlinkz/calamares-nixos-extensions/commit/837ca4da5521a74d3b5ca6f7b88890a6713faa22"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vlinkz/calamares-nixos-extensions/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 24007, "QML": 4706}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20145996?v=4", "stargazers": 0, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
