Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`, may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary for users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running their own instance may apply the patch manually."], "published": "2023-05-08T21:15:11.263", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["effectindex"], "productName": ["tripreporter"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/security/advisories/GHSA-356r-rwp8-h6m6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/commit/bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 125644, "Vue": 66558, "JavaScript": 20295, "CSS": 15088, "Makefile": 1693, "HTML": 967, "Dockerfile": 609}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47508259?v=4", "stargazers": 10, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
