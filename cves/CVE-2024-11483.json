This flaw allows attackers to escalate privileges by improperly leveraging read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access. This issue affects API endpoints that rely on ansible_base.oauth2_provider for OAuth2 authentication. While the impact is limited to actions within the userâ€™s assigned permissions, it undermines scoped access controls, potentially allowing unintended modifications in the application and consuming services."], "published": "2024-11-25T04:15:03.683", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 for RHEL 9"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/ansible/django-ansible-base/commit/845b3e1838cc0762a7f9f3e0379c5274519d9a44"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/ansible/django-ansible-base/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 1782064, "HTML": 45730, "Shell": 8762, "Dockerfile": 3094, "Makefile": 2879, "CSS": 92}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1507452?v=4", "stargazers": 22, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
