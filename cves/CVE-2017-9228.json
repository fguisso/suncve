A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption."], "published": "2017-05-24T15:29:00.370", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/3b63d12038c8d8fc278e81c942fa9bec7c704c8b"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "regexp", "regular-expression"], "langs": {"C": 2586514, "Shell": 64509, "Python": 49364, "HTML": 17279, "CMake": 12267, "Makefile": 8691, "M4": 2689, "C++": 1193, "Batchfile": 464}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/884169?v=4", "stargazers": 2407, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
