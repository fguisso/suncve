A refactor of the code fetching the list of interfaces for multiple APIs introduced a corner case on platforms where allocating 0 bytes of memory results in a NULL pointer. This corner case would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent crash of virtinterfaced. This issue could allow clients connecting to the read-only socket to crash the virtinterfaced daemon."], "published": "2024-08-30T17:15:15.783", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Advanced Virtualization"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
