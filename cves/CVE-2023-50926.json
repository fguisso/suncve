An out-of-bounds read can be caused by an incoming DIO message when using the RPL-Lite implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system. More specifically, the prefix information of the DIO message contains a field that specifies the length of an IPv6 address prefix. The value of this field is not validated, which means that an attacker can set a value that is longer than the maximum prefix length. Subsequently, a memcmp function call that compares different prefixes can be called with a length argument that surpasses the boundary of the array allocated for the prefix, causing an out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in the next release. Users are advised to update as soon as they are able to or to manually apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2721."], "published": "2024-02-14T20:15:45.163", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["contiki-ng"], "productName": ["contiki-ng"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-jp4p-fq85-jch2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["6lowpan", "6lowpan-border-router", "6tisch", "contiki-ng", "iot", "rpl", "tsch", "wsn"], "langs": {"C": 13758081, "GSC": 688626, "Python": 243324, "CSS": 53122, "Shell": 53016, "Makefile": 49706, "Linker Script": 36491, "Java": 33209, "Perl": 22060, "JavaScript": 14233, "Dockerfile": 7314, "XSLT": 4947}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067801?v=4", "stargazers": 1385, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
