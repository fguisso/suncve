Affected versions are missing origin verification in a postMessage handler which introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The editor-sdk.js file defines three different class-like functions, which employ a global message event listener: SquidexSidebar, SquidexWidget, and SquidexFormField. The registered event listener takes some action based on the type of the received message. For example, when the SquidexFormField receives a message with the type valueChanged, the value property is updated. The SquidexFormField class is for example used in the editor-editorjs.html file, which can be accessed via the public wwwroot folder. It uses the onValueChanged method to register a callback function, which passes the value provided from the message event to the editor.render. Passing an attacker-controlled value to this function introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability."], "published": "2023-11-07T19:15:11.573", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Squidex"], "productName": ["squidex"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/security/advisories/GHSA-7q4f-fprr-5jw8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asp-net", "asp-net-core", "cms", "csharp", "headless-cms", "mongodb"], "langs": {"C#": 7625691, "TypeScript": 2462694, "HTML": 973637, "SCSS": 173362, "JavaScript": 37858, "CSS": 11308, "PowerShell": 6830, "Dockerfile": 5479, "Mustache": 4810, "Shell": 1663, "Batchfile": 691}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25371797?v=4", "stargazers": 2365, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
