If cruddl starting with version 1.1.0 and prior to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2 is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB. Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected. The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled. The issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl. As a workaround, users can temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas."], "published": "2022-09-08T22:15:08.713", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["AEB-labs"], "productName": ["cruddl"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/security/advisories/GHSA-qm4w-4995-vg7f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/commit/13b9233733ed6fc822718a07bc90a80cd3492698"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["arangodb", "graphql", "graphql-js", "hacktoberfest", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2290927, "JavaScript": 126548, "Shell": 329}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31932397?v=4", "stargazers": 132, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
