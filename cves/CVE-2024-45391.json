Sites building with Tina CMS's command line interface (CLI) prior to version 1.6.2 that use a search token may be vulnerable to the search token being leaked via lock file (tina-lock.json). Administrators of Tina-enabled websites with search setup should rotate their key immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli version 1.6.2. Upgrading and rotating the search token is required for the proper fix."], "published": "2024-09-03T20:15:08.627", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tinacms"], "productName": ["tinacms"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/security/advisories/GHSA-4qrm-9h4r-v2fx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/commit/110f1ceea4574d636a64526648f7c8bf6539b26a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "content-management-system", "forestry", "markdown", "nextjs", "react", "tina", "tinacms", "typescript"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2331699, "JavaScript": 51830, "CSS": 15028, "Shell": 3270, "MDX": 2362, "HTML": 2182}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54718400?v=4", "stargazers": 12413, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
