The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web UI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information on an affected system."], "published": "2020-11-18T18:15:12.167", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
