An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>\n<p>There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to open an email attachment or click a link in an email or instant message.</li>\n<li>In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince users to open the document file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows GDI handles objects in the memory.</p>\n"], "published": "2020-10-16T23:15:14.320", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1909", "Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 2004", "Windows Server version 2004", "Windows 10 Version 1507", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 8.1", "Windows Server 2012", "Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012 R2", "Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
