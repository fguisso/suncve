If the connection has CORS enabled but one route has it off, and the route is not GET, the OPTIONS prefetch request will return the default CORS headers and then the actual request will go through and return no CORS headers. This defeats the purpose of turning CORS on the route."], "published": "2018-05-31T20:29:00.360", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["HackerOne"], "productName": ["hapi node module"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
