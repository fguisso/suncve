Dell Update Package (DUP) Framework file versions prior to 3.8.3.67 used in Dell Client Platforms. The vulnerability is limited to the DUP framework during the time window when a DUP is being executed by an administrator. During this time window, a locally authenticated low privilege malicious user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by tricking an administrator into running a trusted binary, causing it to load a malicious DLL and allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim system. The vulnerability does not affect the actual binary payload that the DUP delivers."], "published": "2019-09-24T16:15:12.447", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Dell EMC", "Dell"], "productName": ["Dell EMC Servers: Networking and Fibre Channel Drivers: Dell Update Package (DUP) Framework file ", "Dell EMC Servers: all other Drivers, BIOS and Firmware: Dell Update Package (DUP) Framework file ", "Dell Client Platforms: Dell Update Packages (DUP) Framework file"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
