The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload zip files containing malicious SVG bombs (similar to a billion laughs attack), causing resource exhaustion in Admin UI browser tabs and creating a persistent denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`). This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading."], "published": "2023-07-18T19:15:09.927", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ethyca"], "productName": ["fides"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-3rw2-wfc8-wmj5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/8beaace082b325e693dc7682029a3cb7e6c2b69d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["data", "data-privacy", "data-privacy-compliance", "developer-tools", "gdpr", "hacktoberfest", "privacy-as-code", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 7660018, "TypeScript": 5051484, "JavaScript": 365464, "CSS": 39118, "HTML": 33307, "SCSS": 18712, "Dockerfile": 4481, "Jinja": 3618, "Mako": 494}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50628321?v=4", "stargazers": 392, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
