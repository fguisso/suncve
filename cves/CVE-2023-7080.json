This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.\n\nThis issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2. Whilst wrangler dev's inspector server listens on local interfaces by default as of wrangler@3.16.0, an  SSRF vulnerability in miniflare https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-fwvg-2739-22v7 Â (CVE-2023-7078) allowed access from the local network until wrangler@3.18.0. wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2 introduced validation for the Origin/Host headers.\n"], "published": "2023-12-29T12:15:47.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cloudflare"], "productName": ["wrangler"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-f8mp-x433-5wpf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cli", "cloudflare", "cloudflare-workers", "javascript", "serverless", "wasm"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 8137438, "JavaScript": 278063, "Mustache": 59337, "HTML": 28528, "CSS": 12195, "Cap'n Proto": 6730, "Vue": 5566, "Shell": 1911, "Makefile": 1672, "Python": 870, "WebAssembly": 629}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/314135?v=4", "stargazers": 3026, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
