In affected versions if using Flask-AppBuilder OAuth, an attacker can share a carefully crafted URL with a trusted domain for an application built with Flask-AppBuilder, this URL can redirect a user to a malicious site. This is an open redirect vulnerability. To resolve this issue upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.2.2 or above. If upgrading is infeasible users may filter HTTP traffic containing `?next={next-site}` where the `next-site` domain is different from the application you are protecting as a workaround."], "published": "2021-09-08T18:15:14.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dpgaspar"], "productName": ["Flask-AppBuilder"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/security/advisories/GHSA-624f-cqvr-3qw4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/commit/6af28521589599b1dbafd6313256229ee9a4fa74"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["authentication", "crud", "flask", "python", "rbac", "rest", "rest-api", "sql", "web"], "langs": {"Python": 1139598, "HTML": 91928, "JavaScript": 14409, "CSS": 11547, "Shell": 3075}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4", "stargazers": 4797, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
