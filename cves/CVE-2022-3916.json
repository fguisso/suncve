This issue would affect users of shared computers more (especially if cookies are not cleared), due to a lack of root session validation, and the reuse of session ids across root and user authentication sessions. This enables an attacker to resolve a user session attached to a previously authenticated user; when utilizing the refresh token, they will be issued a token for the original user."], "published": "2023-09-20T15:15:11.583", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Single Sign-On 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.1", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9", "RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
