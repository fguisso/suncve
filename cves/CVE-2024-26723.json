The issue can be reproduced like this:\nip link add name bond0 type bond miimon 100 mode balance-xor\nip link set dev eth0 master bond0\n\nThe reason is because when adding a interface under the lag it would go\nthrough all the ports and try to figure out which other ports are under\nthat lag interface. And the issue is that lan966x can have ports that are\nNULL pointer as they are not probed. So then iterating over these ports\nit would just crash as they are NULL pointers.\nThe fix consists in actually checking for NULL pointers before accessing\nsomething from the ports. Like we do in other places."], "published": "2024-04-03T15:15:54.143", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
