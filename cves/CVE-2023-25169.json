In affected versions a user present in a yearly review topic that is then anonymised will still have some data linked to its original account. This issue has been patched in commit `b3ab33bbf7` which is included in the latest version of the Discourse Yearly Review plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the `yearly_review_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the issue. Also, it's possible to edit the anonymised user's old data in the yearly review topics manually."], "published": "2023-03-06T18:15:10.473", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["discourse-yearly-review"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/security/advisories/GHSA-x2r8-v85c-x3x7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/commit/b3ab33bbf7130fca54764cf0336395a8a1eeaf3c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["discourse-plugin"], "langs": {"Ruby": 36187, "HTML": 2058, "JavaScript": 1965, "SCSS": 1107}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 14, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
