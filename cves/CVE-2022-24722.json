Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them."], "published": "2022-03-02T23:15:09.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["github"], "productName": ["view_component"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/github/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-cm9w-c4rj-r2cf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/github/view_component/commit/3f82a6e62578ff6f361aba24a1feb2caccf83ff9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/github/view_component/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 357825, "HTML": 18362, "Shell": 5210, "CSS": 998, "Dockerfile": 732, "Haml": 592, "Slim": 431, "JavaScript": 73}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93401166?v=4", "stargazers": 3387, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
