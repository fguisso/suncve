Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked. The issue has been resolved in version 1.0.6 and the implementation now properly checks if the requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`."], "published": "2022-09-15T22:15:11.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tauri-apps"], "productName": ["tauri"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-28m8-9j7v-x499"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["desktop-app", "high-performance", "mobile-app", "native-app", "rust", "web-frontend", "webview"], "langs": {"Rust": 2505293, "TypeScript": 215061, "NSIS": 109906, "Kotlin": 66526, "JavaScript": 50019, "Shell": 43350, "Swift": 22030, "Dockerfile": 2143, "HTML": 2143, "PowerShell": 1951, "AppleScript": 1828, "Svelte": 1725, "CSS": 1658, "Standard ML": 1348, "Ruby": 839, "Objective-C": 414, "Objective-C++": 100, "C++": 82}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54536011?v=4", "stargazers": 91208, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
