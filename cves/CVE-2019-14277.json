This vulnerability can lead to local file disclosure, DoS, or URI invocation attacks (i.e., SSRF with resultant remote code execution). NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because “All attacks that use external entities are blocked (no external DTD or file inclusions, no SSRF). The impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability is not proved on any version.”"], "published": "2019-07-26T04:15:11.683", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
