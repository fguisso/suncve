This is dangerous as the \"bestinformed Infoclient\" runs with elevated permissions (\"nt authority\\system\"). By changing the server address to a malicious server, or a script simulating a server, the user is able to escalate his privileges by abusing certain features of the \"bestinformed Web\" server. Those features include:\n  *  Pushing of malicious update packages\n  *  Arbitrary Registry Read as \"nt authority\\system\"\n\n\nAn attacker is able to escalate his privileges to \"nt authority\\system\" on the Windows client running the \"bestinformed Infoclient\". \n\n\nThis attack is not possible if a custom configuration (\"Infoclient.ini\") containing the flags \"ShowOnTaskbar=false\" or \"DisabledItems=stPort,stAddress\" is deployed."], "published": "2025-02-18T08:15:10.597", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cordaware"], "productName": ["bestinformed Infoclient"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
