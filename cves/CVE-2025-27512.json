Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy` to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to reboot the system into the deployed update. Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket. The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. A workaround is to manually add a following polkit rule, instructions for which are available in the GitHub Security Advisory."], "published": "2025-03-17T15:15:44.557", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["coreos"], "productName": ["zincati"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/coreos/zincati/security/advisories/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825"], "commits": ["https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/01d8e89f799e6ba21bdf7dc668abce23bd0d8f78", "https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/28a43aa2c1edda091ba659677d73c13e6e3ea99d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/coreos/zincati/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 236072, "Shell": 10802, "Jsonnet": 3273, "Makefile": 1049}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3730757?v=4", "stargazers": 165, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
