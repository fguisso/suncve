The issue affects only NGINX products that are built with the module ngx_http_mp4_module, when the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Further, the attack is possible only if an attacker can trigger processing of a specially crafted audio or video file with the module ngx_http_mp4_module."], "published": "2022-10-19T22:15:12.717", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["F5"], "productName": ["NGINX", "NGINX Plus", "NGINX Open Source Subscription"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
