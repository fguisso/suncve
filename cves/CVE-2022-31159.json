A partial-path traversal issue exists within the `downloadDirectory` method in the AWS S3 TransferManager component of the AWS SDK for Java v1 prior to version 1.12.261. Applications using the SDK control the `destinationDirectory` argument, but S3 object keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects. The `downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem object in the object key but contained an issue in the validation logic for the key name. A knowledgeable actor could bypass the validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot in the bucket key. Under certain conditions, this could permit them to retrieve a directory from their S3 bucket that is one level up in the filesystem from their working directory. This issueâ€™s scope is limited to directories whose name prefix matches the destinationDirectory. E.g. for destination directory`/tmp/foo`, the actor can cause a download to `/tmp/foo-bar`, but not `/tmp/bar`. If `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` is used to download an untrusted buckets contents, the contents of that bucket can be written outside of the intended destination directory. Version 1.12.261 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, when calling `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory`, pass a `KeyFilter` that forbids `S3ObjectSummary` objects that `getKey` method return a string containing the substring `..` ."], "published": "2022-07-15T18:15:09.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aws"], "productName": ["aws-sdk-java"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/security/advisories/GHSA-c28r-hw5m-5gv3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["amazon", "aws", "aws-sdk", "java"], "langs": {"Java": 1022720519, "FreeMarker": 192196, "Gherkin": 25063, "Scilab": 5966, "Shell": 442, "Batchfile": 373}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2232217?v=4", "stargazers": 4149, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
