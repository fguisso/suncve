In affected versions when the application being run by linkerd is susceptible to SSRF, an attacker could potentially trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by making requests to localhost:4191/shutdown. Linkerd could introduce an optional environment variable to control a token that must be passed as a header. Linkerd should reject shutdown requests that do not include this header. This issue has been addressed in release version edge-24.6.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-07-15T22:15:03.017", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["linkerd"], "productName": ["linkerd2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/security/advisories/GHSA-6v94-gj6x-jqj7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/commit/35fb2d6d11ef6520ae516dd717790529f85224fa"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/security/advisories/GHSA-6v94-gj6x-jqj7", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-native", "golang", "kubernetes", "linkerd", "rust", "service-mesh"], "langs": {"Go": 3044570, "Rust": 1451056, "JavaScript": 427558, "Shell": 74705, "Smarty": 23634, "Makefile": 20330, "Dockerfile": 12341, "CSS": 6326, "HTML": 1271, "PowerShell": 804, "Mustache": 436, "Batchfile": 417}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25301026?v=4", "stargazers": 10894, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
