The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck` which passes unfiltered input to the `explain_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed through the `oracle.py` `execute_check` method and to the `explain_check` method for execution. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-103`."], "published": "2023-04-19T00:15:09.510", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["hhyo"], "productName": ["Archery"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-3p43-89m6-7x5w"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["archery", "binlog2sql", "clickhouse", "data-masking", "database-schema", "ddl", "dml", "gh-ost", "inception", "mysql", "oracle", "sql-audit", "sql-query"], "langs": {"Python": 2528286, "Shell": 10307, "Mustache": 2102, "Dockerfile": 873}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8842982?v=4", "stargazers": 6286, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
