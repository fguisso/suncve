In affected versions the `torbot.modules.validators.validate_link function` uses the python-validators URL validation regex. This particular regular expression has an exponential complexity which allows an attacker to cause an application crash using a well-crafted argument. An attacker can use a well-crafted URL argument to exploit the vulnerability in the regular expression and cause a Denial of Service on the system. The validators file has been removed in version 4.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-10-18T21:15:09.640", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["DedSecInside"], "productName": ["TorBot"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot/security/advisories/GHSA-72qw-p7hh-m3ff"], "commits": ["https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot/commit/ef6e06bc7785355b1701d5524eb4550441086ac4"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot/security/advisories/GHSA-72qw-p7hh-m3ff", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["algorithm", "crawler", "dark-web", "dedsec-inside", "deepweb", "go", "hacking", "hacktoberfest", "osint", "projects", "psnappz", "python", "python-web-crawler", "python3", "security", "security-tools", "spider", "tor", "tor-network", "torbot"], "langs": {"Python": 30414, "Dockerfile": 671, "Shell": 541}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20391554?v=4", "stargazers": 3214, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
