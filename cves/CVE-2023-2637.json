This may allow the threat actor to make malicious changes to the database that will be deployed when a legitimate FactoryTalk Policy Manager user deploys a security policy model. User interaction is required for this vulnerability to be successfully exploited.\n\n"], "published": "2023-06-13T21:15:09.917", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Rockwell Automation"], "productName": ["FactoryTalk System Services"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
