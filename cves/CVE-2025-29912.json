In versions 1.3.3 and prior, an unsigned integer underflow in the `Crypto_TC_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib leads to a heap buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when the `fl` (frame length) field in a Telecommand (TC) packet is set to 0. This underflow causes the frame length to be interpreted as 65535, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access. This critical vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution. Users of CryptoLib are advised to apply the recommended patch or avoid processing untrusted TC packets until a fix is available."], "published": "2025-03-17T23:15:18.450", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nasa"], "productName": ["CryptoLib"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-3f5x-r59x-p8cf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/ca39cb96f21e76102aefb956d2c8c0ba0bd143ca"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-3f5x-r59x-p8cf", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ccsds", "cfs", "communications", "data-link", "ground-station", "sdls-ep", "space-communications", "space-data-link-security-protocol", "space-network", "spack-data-link"], "langs": {"C": 2002164, "C++": 58820, "CMake": 24681, "Python": 15181, "Shell": 7065, "Dockerfile": 2622, "Makefile": 898}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848102?v=4", "stargazers": 100, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
