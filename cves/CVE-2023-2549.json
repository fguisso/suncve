This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'createTempAccountLink' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create a new user with administrator role via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. An attacker can leverage CVE-2023-2545 to get the login link or request a password reset to the new user's email address."], "published": "2023-05-31T03:15:09.577", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["featherplugins"], "productName": ["Custom Login Page | Temporary Users | Rebrand Login | Login Captcha"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
