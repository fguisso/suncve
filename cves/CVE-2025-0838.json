As a result, it was possible for a caller to pass a very large size that would cause an integer overflow when computing the size of the container's backing store, and a subsequent out-of-bounds memory write. Subsequent accesses to the container might also access out-of-bounds memory. We recommend upgrading past commit 5a0e2cb5e3958dd90bb8569a2766622cb74d90c1"], "published": "2025-02-21T15:15:11.890", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["abseil"], "productName": ["abseil-cpp"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/5a0e2cb5e3958dd90bb8569a2766622cb74d90c1"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C++": 9156667, "Starlark": 241543, "CMake": 213377, "NASL": 201698, "C": 82638, "Shell": 44892, "Python": 22761, "Batchfile": 6284, "Linker Script": 352}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26718316?v=4", "stargazers": 15704, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
