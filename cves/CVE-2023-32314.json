A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-05-15T20:15:09.177", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["patriksimek"], "productName": ["vm2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-whpj-8f3w-67p5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/d88105f99752305c5b8a77b63ddee3ec86912daf"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-whpj-8f3w-67p5", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "node-js", "sandbox", "security", "vm"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 241704, "TypeScript": 7}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000058?v=4", "stargazers": 3902, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/AdarkSt/Honeypot_Smart_Infrastructure", "https://github.com/AdarkSt/Honeypot_Smart_Infrastructure"]}
