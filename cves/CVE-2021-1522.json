This vulnerability exists because a password policy check is incomplete at the time a password is changed at server side using the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted API request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change their own password to a value that does not comply with the configured strong authentication requirements."], "published": "2021-08-04T18:15:08.287", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
