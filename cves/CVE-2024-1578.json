Random characters being dropped from ID card numbers compromises the uniqueness of ID cards that can, therefore, result in a security issue if the users are using the ‘ID card self-registration’ function."], "published": "2024-09-16T07:15:02.030", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Rebranded by NT-ware (originally developed and provided by rf IDEAS)"], "productName": ["MiCard PLUS Ci", "MiCard PLUS BLE"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
