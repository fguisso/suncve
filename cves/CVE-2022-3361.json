This makes it possible for attackers with administrative privileges to supply arbitrary paths using traversal (../../) to access and include files outside of the intended directory. If an attacker can successfully upload a php file then remote code execution via inclusion may also be possible. Note: for users with less than administrative capabilities, /wp-admin access needs to be enabled for that user in order for this to be exploitable by those users."], "published": "2022-11-29T21:15:10.903", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ultimatemember"], "productName": ["Ultimate Member â€“ User Profile, User Registration, Login & Membership Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
