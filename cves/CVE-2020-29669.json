This process has a vulnerability which can be used to take over the administrator account and results in shell access. As the admin user may read the /etc/shadow file, the password hashes of each user (including root) can be dumped. The root hash can be cracked easily which results in a complete system compromise."], "published": "2020-12-14T02:15:11.453", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/code-byter/CVE-2020-29669", "https://github.com/code-byter/CVE-2020-29669"]}
