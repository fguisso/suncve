In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4."], "published": "2020-10-16T17:15:12.057", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["crossbeam-rs"], "productName": ["crossbeam"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/security/advisories/GHSA-v5m7-53cv-f3hx"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["concurrency", "data-structures", "lock-free", "parallelism", "rust", "synchronization", "threads"], "langs": {"Rust": 1267119, "Shell": 9966, "Go": 4294, "Python": 3800}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26314159?v=4", "stargazers": 7769, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
