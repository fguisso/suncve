The response headers and body were sent but the client would continue waiting as Undertow does not send the expected 0\\r\\n termination of the chunked response. This results in uncontrolled resource consumption, leaving the server side to a denial of service attack. This happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios."], "published": "2024-07-08T21:15:12.480", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat build of Apache Camel 3.20.7 for Spring Boot", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.1 for Spring Boot", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.4.2 for Spring Boot", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 9", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel for Spring Boot 3", "Red Hat build of Apache Camel - HawtIO", "Red Hat Build of Keycloak", "Red Hat build of Quarkus", "Red Hat Data Grid 8", "Red Hat Fuse 7", "Red Hat Integration Camel K", "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7", "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack", "Red Hat Process Automation 7", "Red Hat Single Sign-On 7"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
