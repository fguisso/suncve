It's usually true, but it's still\npossible that the first interface is bound with another driver via a\nmalformed descriptor.  Then it may lead to a memory corruption, as\nspotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata as\nstruct imon_context object although it's a completely different one\nthat was assigned by another driver.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is\nreally bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem\nabove at the probe time."], "published": "2024-05-21T16:15:14.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
