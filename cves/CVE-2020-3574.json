The vulnerability is due to insufficient TCP ingress packet rate limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impact operations of the phone or cause the phone to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition."], "published": "2020-11-06T19:15:14.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IP Phones with Multiplatform Firmware "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
