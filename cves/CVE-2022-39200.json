In affected versions events retrieved from a remote homeserver using the `/get_missing_events` path did not have their signatures verified correctly. This could potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified events to Dendrite via this endpoint. Note that this does not apply to events retrieved through other endpoints (e.g. `/event`, `/state`) as they have been correctly verified. Homeservers that have federation disabled are not vulnerable. The problem has been fixed in Dendrite 0.9.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-09-12T20:15:12.960", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["dendrite"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/security/advisories/GHSA-pfw4-xjgm-267c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/commit/2792d0490f3771488bad346981b8c26479a872c3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dendrite", "golang", "hacktoberfest", "matrix", "matrix-homeserver", "matrix-org"], "langs": {"Go": 4856446, "Dockerfile": 12359, "Shell": 10589, "JavaScript": 10077, "Python": 9860, "Smarty": 2270, "HTML": 1703, "CSS": 1224}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 5698, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
