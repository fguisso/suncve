A control-flow timing lean has been identified in the reference implementation of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism when it is compiled with Clang 15-18 for `-Os`, `-O1`, and other compilation options. A proof-of-concept local attack on the reference implementation leaks the entire ML-KEM 512 secret key in ~10 minutes using end-to-end decapsulation timing measurements. The issue has been fixed in version 0.10.1. As a possible workaround, some compiler options may produce vectorized code that does not leak secret information, however relying on these compiler options as a workaround may not be reliable."], "published": "2024-06-10T13:15:50.700", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["open-quantum-safe"], "productName": ["liboqs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-f2v9-5498-2vpp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/982c762c242ef549c914891b47bf6e0ed6321f91", "https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/commit/9b8d30698a3e7449aeb34e62339d4176f11e3c6c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["crypto", "cryptography", "key-exchange-algorithms", "lattice-based-crypto", "module-lattices", "post-quantum", "post-quantum-cryptography"], "langs": {"C": 270472, "Assembly": 18308, "Makefile": 9371, "Shell": 1018}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24883661?v=4", "stargazers": 945, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
