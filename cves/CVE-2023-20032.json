An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV scanning process, or else crash the process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog [\"https://blog.clamav.net/\"]."], "published": "2023-03-01T08:15:11.907", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Secure Web Appliance", "Cisco Secure Endpoint", "Cisco Secure Endpoint Private Cloud Administration Portal"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
