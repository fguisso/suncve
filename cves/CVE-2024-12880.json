The issue arises from the way tenant IDs are handled in the application. If a user has access to multiple tenants, they can manipulate their tenant access to query and access API tokens of other tenants. This vulnerability affects the following endpoints: /v1/system/token_list, /v1/system/new_token, /v1/api/token_list, /v1/api/new_token, and /v1/api/rm. An attacker can exploit this to access other tenants' API tokens, perform actions on behalf of other tenants, and access their data."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:31.467", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["infiniflow"], "productName": ["infiniflow/ragflow"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
