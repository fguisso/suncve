For example, adding \"_bsontype\":\"a\" can sometimes interfere with a query filter. NOTE: this CVE is about Mongoose's failure to work around this _bsontype special case that exists in older versions of the bson parser (aka the mongodb/js-bson project)."], "published": "2019-10-10T02:05:46.833", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/commit/f3eca5b94d822225c04e96cbeed9f095afb3c31c"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["mongo", "mongodb", "nodejs", "odm", "orm"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 4338827, "TypeScript": 234544, "Pug": 6147, "Shell": 2182, "HTML": 122}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/887802?v=4", "stargazers": 27169, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
