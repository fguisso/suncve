This vulnerability in versions prior to 2.37.1 lets Git for Windows' installer execute a binary into `C:\\mingw64\\bin\\git.exe` by mistake. This only happens upon a fresh install, not when upgrading Git for Windows. A patch is included in version 2.37.1. Two workarounds are available. Create the `C:\\mingw64` folder and remove read/write access from this folder, or disallow arbitrary authenticated users to create folders in `C:\\`."], "published": "2022-07-12T21:15:09.843", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["git-for-windows"], "productName": ["git"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gjrj-fxvp-hjj2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest"], "langs": {"C": 12020956, "Shell": 8680483, "Perl": 1112312, "Tcl": 857873, "Python": 183463, "Makefile": 174034, "Meson": 120604, "C++": 116083, "JavaScript": 49713, "CMake": 48147, "M4": 38265, "Roff": 26859, "SmPL": 15676, "Go": 15064, "Batchfile": 11440, "CSS": 10664, "Rust": 6798, "Emacs Lisp": 660, "PowerShell": 478, "ReScript": 92}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4571183?v=4", "stargazers": 8618, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
