When the software is installed with a non-default installation directory off of the system root, the installer fails to properly set ACLs. This allows lower privileged users to replace the VPN executable with a malicious one. When a higher privileged user such as an Administrator launches that executable, it is possible for the lower privileged user to escalate to Administrator privileges."], "published": "2021-12-30T22:15:09.957", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Bitmask Riseup VPN 0.21.6"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
