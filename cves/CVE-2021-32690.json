In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on."], "published": "2021-06-16T22:15:07.737", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["helm"], "productName": ["helm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/helm/helm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["chart", "charts", "cncf", "helm", "kubernetes"], "langs": {"Go": 2008774, "Shell": 30899, "Makefile": 8750}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15859888?v=4", "stargazers": 27695, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
