The\nmpc_combine is an array that records all the planes per asic. Therefore\nMAX_PLANES should be used as the array size. Using MAX_SURFACES causes\narray overflow when there are more than 3 planes.\n\n[how]\nUse the MAX_PLANES for the mpc_combine array size."], "published": "2024-04-17T16:15:08.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
