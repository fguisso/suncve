This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This only appears to be exploitable on very old versions of WordPress."], "published": "2025-03-13T02:15:13.097", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["arielbrailovsky"], "productName": ["ArielBrailovsky-ViralAd"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
