The portal component is delivered with an insecure default User Profile community configuration that allows anonymous users to retrieve the account names of all portal users via /portal/server.pt/user/user/ requests. When WCI is synchronised with Active Directory (AD), this vulnerability can expose the account names of all AD users. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support."], "published": "2018-09-18T02:29:01.183", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
