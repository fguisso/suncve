Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference while encoding a 6LoWPAN IPHC header. The NULL pointer dereference causes a hard fault exception, leading to denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, apply the patches manually."], "published": "2023-04-24T16:15:07.690", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["RIOT-OS"], "productName": ["RIOT"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-8x69-5fhj-72wh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "hacktoberfest", "internet", "internet-of-things", "internetofthings", "iot", "microcontrollers", "os", "riot-os", "riotos", "rtos"], "langs": {"C": 29162636, "C++": 953684, "Makefile": 814677, "Python": 713887, "Linker Script": 67053, "Shell": 28598, "Assembly": 24841, "Rust": 7113, "CMake": 2817, "SmPL": 2591, "Cadence": 887, "Lua": 617, "Vim Snippet": 212, "RenderScript": 33}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3079480?v=4", "stargazers": 5491, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
