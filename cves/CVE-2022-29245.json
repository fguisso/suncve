In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the clientâ€™s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms."], "published": "2022-05-31T17:15:07.837", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sshnet"], "productName": ["SSH.NET"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/security/advisories/GHSA-72p8-v4hg-v45p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/commit/03c6d60736b8f7b42e44d6989a53f9b644a091fb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "network", "scp", "sftp", "ssh"], "langs": {"C#": 5237327, "Dockerfile": 2371, "Shell": 278, "JavaScript": 158}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16708801?v=4", "stargazers": 4128, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
