In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-02-22T20:15:07.693", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pjsip"], "productName": ["pjproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-ffff-m5fm-qm62"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android", "android-ndk", "ios", "nat-traversal", "pjsip", "rtp", "sip", "voip"], "langs": {"C": 15490501, "C++": 1671762, "Python": 553464, "Shell": 399759, "Objective-C": 327121, "C#": 141563, "Java": 115523, "Makefile": 115518, "Mathematica": 86105, "SWIG": 43117, "Swift": 38034, "CSS": 21213, "Kotlin": 18705, "Rust": 4860, "Objective-C++": 3801, "HTML": 3320, "QMake": 3180, "Batchfile": 1805, "QML": 1121, "Pan": 288, "Prolog": 25}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6085234?v=4", "stargazers": 2263, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
