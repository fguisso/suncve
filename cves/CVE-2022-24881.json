In versions prior to 1.0.0.beta.2, attackers can implement remote code execution through malicious code injection of the template engine. This happens because Velocity and freemarker templates are introduced but input verification is not done. The fault is rectified in version 1.0.0.beta.2."], "published": "2022-04-26T16:15:47.737", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ballcat-projects"], "productName": ["ballcat-codegen"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen/security/advisories/GHSA-fv3m-xhqw-9m79"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen/commit/84a7cb38daf0295b93aba21d562ec627e4eb463b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["code-generator", "spring-boot", "typescript", "vue3"], "langs": {"Java": 191921, "Vue": 120852, "TypeScript": 43138, "Batchfile": 1454, "JavaScript": 784, "Dockerfile": 745, "Less": 231}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81626402?v=4", "stargazers": 74, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
