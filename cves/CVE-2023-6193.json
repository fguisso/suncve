An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending PATH_CHALLENGE frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that PATH_RESPONSE frames can only be sent at the slower rate than they are received; leading to storage of path validation data in an unbounded queue. \nQuiche versions greater than 0.19.0 address this problem."], "published": "2023-12-12T14:15:07.797", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cloudflare"], "productName": ["quiche"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/security/advisories/GHSA-w3vp-jw9m-f9pm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["http3", "network-programming", "protocol", "quic", "rust"], "langs": {"Rust": 3314276, "C": 107169, "Shell": 5779, "Makefile": 2950, "Dockerfile": 2248}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/314135?v=4", "stargazers": 10026, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
