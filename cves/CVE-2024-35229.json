Prior to version 1.3.10, there is a very specific pattern `f(a(),b()); check_if_a_executed_last()` in Yul that exposes a bug in evaluation order of Yul function arguments. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.3.10. As a workaround, update and redeploy affected contracts.\n"], "published": "2024-05-27T17:15:09.510", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matter-labs"], "productName": ["era-compiler-solidity"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/security/advisories/GHSA-jf9w-7f5g-j95p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/commit/46ce047b51576495779b9f67534207d8154eab79"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["team-compiler"], "langs": {"Rust": 1151005, "Yul": 9856, "Solidity": 5778, "LLVM": 5073, "Batchfile": 1801, "Shell": 1578}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42489169?v=4", "stargazers": 71, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
