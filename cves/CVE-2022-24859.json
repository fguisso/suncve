In versions prior to 1.27.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 if the code attempts to get the content stream. The reason is that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage` only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream."], "published": "2022-04-18T19:15:09.757", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["py-pdf"], "productName": ["PyPDF2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/security/advisories/GHSA-xcjx-m2pj-8g79"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["help-wanted", "pdf", "pdf-documents", "pdf-manipulation", "pdf-parser", "pdf-parsing", "pypdf2", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 1696369, "Makefile": 774}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102914013?v=4", "stargazers": 8903, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
