A denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1: an unbounded recursion can cause Exiv2 to crash by exhausting the stack. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The denial-of-service is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-02-12T23:15:08.853", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Exiv2"], "productName": ["exiv2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-crmj-qh74-2r36"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cli", "exif", "exif-interface", "exif-metadata", "image-metadata", "iptc", "iptc-metadata", "xmp", "xmp-metadata"], "langs": {"C++": 4300067, "Python": 937903, "CMake": 61321, "C": 35700, "Meson": 13772, "Shell": 8085, "Batchfile": 914, "CodeQL": 599, "QMake": 392, "sed": 370}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23559442?v=4", "stargazers": 995, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
