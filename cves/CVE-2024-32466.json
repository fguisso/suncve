For the `/v2/projects/translations` and `/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations` endpoints, translation data was returned even when API key was missing `translation.view` scope. However, it was impossible to fetch the data when user was missing this scope. So this is only relevant for API keys generated by users permitted to `translation.view`. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.57.2\n"], "published": "2024-04-18T15:15:30.300", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tolgee"], "productName": ["tolgee-platform"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-r95p-fqqv-fppc"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/commit/f71213925d6f80019f841db0ead9baa7488c1821"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["angular", "hacktoberfest", "i18n", "i18next", "internationalization", "javascript", "l10n", "localization", "localization-tool", "react", "svelte", "translation", "translation-management", "translations", "translations-api", "vue"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 3434150, "Kotlin": 2667448, "JavaScript": 20192, "Shell": 1768, "Dockerfile": 1408, "PLpgSQL": 663, "HTML": 483}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78480209?v=4", "stargazers": 2699, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
