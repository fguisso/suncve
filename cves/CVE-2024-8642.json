The issue requires to have a dataplane configured to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the module \"transfer-data-plane\". The affected code was marked deprecated from the version 0.6.0 in favour of Dataplane Signaling. In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed."], "published": "2024-09-11T14:15:14.177", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Eclipse Foundation"], "productName": ["Eclipse EDC Connector"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/commit/04899e91dcdb4a407db4eb7af3e7b6ff9a9e9ad6"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Java": 8665629, "Shell": 4078, "Dockerfile": 557}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87998832?v=4", "stargazers": 314, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
