This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is part of Acrobat's page display functionality. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure."], "published": "2017-12-09T06:29:02.523", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Adobe Acrobat Reader 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, 11.0.22 and earlier versions"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
