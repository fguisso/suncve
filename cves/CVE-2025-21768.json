I'm not sure if rpl and seg6\ncan actually hit this, but in principle I don't see why not."], "published": "2025-02-27T03:15:17.480", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
