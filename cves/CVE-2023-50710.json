Prior to version 3.11.7, clients may override named path parameter values from previous requests if the application is using TrieRouter. So, there is a risk that a privileged user may use unintended parameters when deleting REST API resources. TrieRouter is used either explicitly or when the application matches a pattern that is not supported by the default RegExpRouter. Version 3.11.7 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, avoid using TrieRouter directly."], "published": "2023-12-14T18:15:45.270", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["honojs"], "productName": ["hono"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/honojs/hono/security/advisories/GHSA-f6gv-hh8j-q8vq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/honojs/hono/commit/8e2b6b08518998783f66d31db4f21b1b1eecc4c8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/honojs/hono/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aws-lambda", "bun", "cloudflare", "cloudflare-workers", "deno", "npm", "router", "typescript", "web-framework"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 1836229, "JavaScript": 8965, "Dockerfile": 251, "HTML": 12}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98495527?v=4", "stargazers": 23377, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
