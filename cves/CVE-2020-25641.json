A zero-length biovec request issued by the block subsystem could cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, causing a denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with basic privileges to issue requests to a block device, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."], "published": "2020-10-06T14:15:12.603", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["kernel"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
