In affected versions of LibreNMS when a user accesses their device dashboard, one request is sent to `graph.php` to access graphs generated on the particular Device. This request can be accessed by a low privilege user and they can enumerate devices on librenms with their id or hostname. Leveraging this vulnerability a low privilege user can see all devices registered by admin users. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `489978a923` which has been included in release version 23.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-11-17T22:15:08.010", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["librenms"], "productName": ["librenms"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-fpq5-4vwm-78x4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/489978a923ed52aa243d3419889ca298a8a6a7cf"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-fpq5-4vwm-78x4", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "laravel", "librenms", "monitoring", "network", "php", "rrd", "snmp"], "langs": {"PHP": 12470089, "Blade": 702330, "CSS": 253756, "Python": 164704, "JavaScript": 93670, "Vue": 91565, "Shell": 35894, "Perl": 11761, "HTML": 5133, "Hack": 1491}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5791783?v=4", "stargazers": 4152, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
