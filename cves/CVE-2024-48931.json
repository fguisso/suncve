In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the ZimaOS API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v3/file?token=<token>&files=<file_path>` is vulnerable to arbitrary file reading due to improper input validation. By manipulating the `files` parameter, authenticated users can read sensitive system files, including `/etc/shadow`, which contains password hashes for all users. This vulnerability exposes critical system data and poses a high risk for privilege escalation or system compromise. The vulnerability occurs because the API endpoint does not validate or restrict file paths provided via the `files` parameter. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the file path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available."], "published": "2024-10-24T21:15:14.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["IceWhaleTech"], "productName": ["ZimaOS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-hjw2-9gq5-qgwj"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-hjw2-9gq5-qgwj", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Shell": 1021}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91336243?v=4", "stargazers": 1227, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
