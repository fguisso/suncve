This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. It can also be exploited with a contributor-level permission with a page builder plugin."], "published": "2024-01-11T09:15:53.253", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["10web"], "productName": ["Photo Gallery by 10Web â€“ Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
