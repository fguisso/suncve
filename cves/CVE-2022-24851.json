The profile editor tool has an edit profile functionality, the parameters on this page are not properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An authenticated user can store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets triggered when any other user try to access the edit profile page. The pdf editor tool has an edit pdf profile functionality, the logoFile parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an user can enter relative paths like ../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png via tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon has the image on that path(if image is present). Both issues require an attacker to be able to login to LAM admin interface. The issue is fixed in version 7.9.1."], "published": "2022-04-15T19:15:12.383", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["LDAPAccountManager"], "productName": ["lam"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-f2fr-cccr-583v"], "commits": ["https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/3c6f09a3579e048e224eb5a4c4e3eefaa8bccd49"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["duo", "group-management", "lam", "lam-packaging", "ldap", "ldap-management", "php", "user-management", "webauthn", "yubikey"], "langs": {"PHP": 3704039, "JavaScript": 3420778, "CSS": 277560, "HTML": 211913, "Shell": 36434, "Perl": 14941, "Makefile": 9207, "Dockerfile": 6545, "M4": 3653}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17960417?v=4", "stargazers": 443, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
