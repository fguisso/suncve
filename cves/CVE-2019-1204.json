An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could attempt to force Outlook to load a local or remote message store (over SMB).\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker could send a specially crafted email to a victim. Outlook would then attempt to open a pre-configured message store contained in the email upon receipt of the email.\nThis update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring Office fully validates incoming email formatting before processing message content.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:18.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Microsoft Office 2019", "Office 365 ProPlus", "Microsoft Outlook 2016", "Microsoft Outlook 2013 Service Pack 1", "Microsoft Outlook 2010 Service Pack 2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
