Any call with the query argument `?pimcore_preview=true` allows to view unpublished sites. In previous versions of Pimcore, session information would propagate to previews, so only a logged in user could open a preview. This no longer applies. Previews are broad open to any user and with just the hint of a restricted link one could gain access to possible confident / unreleased information. This vulnerability is fixed in 11.2.2 and 11.1.6.1.\n"], "published": "2024-03-26T15:15:49.390", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pimcore"], "productName": ["pimcore"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-5737-rqv4-v445"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/3ae43fb1065f9eb62ad2f542b883858d36d57e53"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-5737-rqv4-v445", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cdp", "cms", "cms-framework", "customer-data-platform", "dam", "data-management", "digital-platform", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-platform", "experience-manager", "hacktoberfest", "master-data-management", "mdm", "online-shop", "pim", "pimcore", "product-information-management", "product-management", "shop", "wcms"], "langs": {"PHP": 6714536, "JavaScript": 320456, "Twig": 8528, "CSS": 2228, "HTML": 687, "Shell": 538}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/686745?v=4", "stargazers": 3536, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
