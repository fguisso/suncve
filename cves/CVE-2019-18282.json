This occurs because the auto flowlabel of a UDP IPv6 packet relies on a 32-bit hashrnd value as a secret, and because jhash (instead of siphash) is used. The hashrnd value remains the same starting from boot time, and can be inferred by an attacker. This affects net/core/flow_dissector.c and related code."], "published": "2020-01-16T16:15:16.950", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
