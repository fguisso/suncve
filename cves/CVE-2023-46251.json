Custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor (_SCEditor_) doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. The impact is be mitigated when: 1. the visual editor is disabled globally (_Admin CP → Configuration → Settings → Clickable Smilies and BB Code: [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_ is set to _Off_), or 2. the visual editor is disabled for individual user accounts (_User CP → Your Profile → Edit Options_: _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_ checkbox is not checked). MyBB 1.8.37 resolves this issue with the commit `6dcaf0b4d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the impact without upgrading MyBB by changing the following setting (_Admin CP → Configuration → Settings_):\n- _Clickable Smilies and BB Code → [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_: _Off_. Similarly, individual MyBB forum users are able to disable the visual editor by diabling the account option (_User CP → Your Profile → Edit Options_) _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_."], "published": "2023-11-06T18:15:08.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mybb"], "productName": ["mybb"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-wj33-q7vj-9fr8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6dcaf0b4db6254f1833fe8dae295d9ddc2219276"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["forum", "mybb", "mysql", "php", "postgresql", "sqlite"], "langs": {"PHP": 5604699, "JavaScript": 144087, "CSS": 68455, "HTML": 14057}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328641?v=4", "stargazers": 1136, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
