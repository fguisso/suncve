This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized ownership transfer, contrary to the original owner's intention of leaving the contract without an owner. It introduces a security risk where an unintended party (pending owner) can gain control of the contract after the original owner has renounced ownership. This could also be used by a malicious owner to simulate leaving a contract without an owner, to later regain ownership by previously having proposed himself as a pending owner. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.16.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-08-31T00:15:05.493", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenZeppelin"], "productName": ["cairo-contracts"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-w2px-25pm-2cf9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/commit/ef87d7847980e0cf83f4b7f3ff23e6590fb643ec"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cairo", "ethereum", "security", "smart-contracts", "starknet"], "langs": {"Rust": 1582705, "Python": 2223}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20820676?v=4", "stargazers": 859, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
