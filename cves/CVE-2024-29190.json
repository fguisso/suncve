In version 3.9.5 Beta and prior, MobSF does not perform any input validation when extracting the hostnames in `android:host`, so requests can also be sent to local hostnames. This can lead to server-side request forgery. An attacker can cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure. Commit 5a8eeee73c5f504a6c3abdf2a139a13804efdb77 has a hotfix for this issue.\n"], "published": "2024-03-22T23:15:07.123", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["MobSF"], "productName": ["Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-wfgj-wrgh-h3r3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/5a8eeee73c5f504a6c3abdf2a139a13804efdb77"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-wfgj-wrgh-h3r3", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android-security", "api-testing", "apk", "cwe", "devsecops", "dynamic-analysis", "ios-security", "malware-analysis", "mastg", "masvs", "mobile-security", "mobsf", "mstg", "owasp", "rest", "runtime-security", "static-analysis", "web-security", "windows-mobile-security"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1582153, "Python": 1357612, "HTML": 1073644, "CSS": 148866, "Shell": 11552, "Batchfile": 4318, "PowerShell": 3089, "Dockerfile": 2909}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25052637?v=4", "stargazers": 18357, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
