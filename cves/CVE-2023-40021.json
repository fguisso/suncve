When comparing a received CSRF token against the expected token, Oppia uses the string equality operator (`==`), which is not safe against timing attacks. By repeatedly submitting invalid tokens, an attacker can brute-force the expected CSRF token character by character. Once they have recovered the token, they can then submit a forged request on behalf of a logged-in user and execute privileged actions on that user's behalf. In particular the function to validate received CSRF tokens is at `oppia.core.controllers.base.CsrfTokenManager.is_csrf_token_valid`. An attacker who can lure a logged-in Oppia user to a malicious website can perform any change on Oppia that the user is authorized to do, including changing profile information; creating, deleting, and changing explorations; etc. Note that the attacker cannot change a user's login credentials. An attack would need to complete within 1 second because every second, the time used in computing the token changes. This issue has been addressed in commit `b89bf80837` which has been included in release `3.3.2-hotfix-2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-08-16T21:15:09.880", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["oppia"], "productName": ["oppia"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/oppia/oppia/security/advisories/GHSA-49jp-pjc3-2532"], "commits": ["https://github.com/oppia/oppia/commit/b89bf808378c1236874b5797a7bda32c77b4af23"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/oppia/oppia/security/advisories/GHSA-49jp-pjc3-2532", "kw": ["poc", "payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/oppia/oppia/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["angular", "angularjs", "appengine", "appengine-python", "education", "hacktoberfest", "interactive", "javascript", "learning", "nonprofit", "python", "sdg", "sdg-4", "sdg4", "sdgs", "teaching", "tutor", "tutorials", "typescript", "web"], "langs": {"Python": 19875504, "TypeScript": 18284173, "HTML": 2454996, "JavaScript": 1199911, "CSS": 593711, "PEG.js": 71377, "Shell": 20234, "Makefile": 13374}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11620230?v=4", "stargazers": 6009, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
