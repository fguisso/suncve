The issue arises from the lack of path sanitization when handling the `name` parameter in the `unInstall_binding` function, allowing an attacker to traverse directories and execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious `__init__.py` file. This vulnerability affects the latest version of the software. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution on the system where parisneo/lollms is deployed."], "published": "2024-05-16T09:15:15.313", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/commit/7ebe08da7e0026b155af4f7be1d6417bc64cf02f"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 1449900, "Shell": 30804, "Batchfile": 16275, "HTML": 6350, "Jupyter Notebook": 4229, "C++": 3433, "Dockerfile": 957, "Makefile": 294}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827993?v=4", "stargazers": 288, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
