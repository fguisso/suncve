These applications allow executable Python code to be embedded in Universal Scene Description (USD) files to customize all aspects of a scene. If a user opens a USD file that contains embedded Python code in one of these applications, the embedded Python code automatically runs with the privileges of the user who opened the file. As a result, an unprivileged remote attacker could craft a USD file containing malicious Python code and persuade a local user to open the file, which may lead to information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service."], "published": "2023-01-13T06:15:11.843", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["NVIDIA"], "productName": ["Omniverse Audio2Face", "Omniverse Create", "NVIDIA Isaac Sim", "Omniverse Machinima", "Omniverse Code", "Omniverse View"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
