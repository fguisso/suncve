Versions prior to 3.0.2 are vulnerable to command injection via single sign-on(SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 3.0.2 contains a patch for this issue."], "published": "2023-06-08T21:15:17.663", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["snowflakedb"], "productName": ["snowflake-connector-python"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/security/advisories/GHSA-5w5m-pfw9-c8fp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/commit/1cdbd3b1403c5ef520d7f4d9614fe35165e101ac"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["database", "python", "sql"], "langs": {"Python": 2558952, "C": 2208578, "C++": 159438, "Shell": 19475, "Cython": 8744, "Batchfile": 2505, "Dockerfile": 2459, "Lua": 1785}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6453780?v=4", "stargazers": 622, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
