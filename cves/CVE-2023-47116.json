The vulnerability affects all versions of Label Studio prior to 1.11.0 and was tested on version 1.8.2. Label Studio's SSRF protections that can be enabled by setting the `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` environment variable can be bypassed to access internal web servers. This is because the current SSRF validation is done by executing a single DNS lookup to verify that the IP address is not in an excluded subnet range. This protection can be bypassed by either using HTTP redirection or performing a DNS rebinding attack."], "published": "2024-01-31T17:15:13.370", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["HumanSignal"], "productName": ["label-studio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-p59w-9gqw-wj8r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/commit/55dd6af4716b92f2bb213fe461d1ffbc380c6a64"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-p59w-9gqw-wj8r", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["annotation", "annotation-tool", "annotations", "boundingbox", "computer-vision", "data-labeling", "dataset", "datasets", "deep-learning", "image-annotation", "image-classification", "image-labeling", "image-labelling-tool", "label-studio", "labeling", "labeling-tool", "mlops", "semantic-segmentation", "text-annotation", "yolo"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 2935193, "Python": 1988019, "TypeScript": 1584880, "SCSS": 380958, "HTML": 71448, "CSS": 50060, "Shell": 16347, "Dockerfile": 7316, "Makefile": 3713}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309720?v=4", "stargazers": 21459, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
