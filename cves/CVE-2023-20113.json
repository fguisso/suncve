This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. These actions could include modifying the system configuration and deleting accounts."], "published": "2023-03-23T17:15:15.343", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco SD-WAN vManage "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
