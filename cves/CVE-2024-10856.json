The vulnerability requires the “delete_prev_date” theme option being enabled. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access or above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing query that can be used to extract sensitive information such as passwords from the database."], "published": "2024-12-24T11:15:07.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wpdevart"], "productName": ["Booking calendar, Appointment Booking System"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
