In version 1.1.8 and prior, due to an unobvious feature of PHP, hashes generated by built-in functions and starting with the `0e` symbols were being handled as zero multiplied with the `e` number. Therefore, the hash value was equal to 0. The maintainers fixed this in version 1.1.9 by using `===` instead of `==` in comparisons where it is possible (e.g. on sign in/sign up handlers)."], "published": "2022-09-06T21:15:08.830", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mesosoi"], "productName": ["silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mesosoi/silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker/security/advisories/GHSA-w4wq-7j4q-j2fh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mesosoi/silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13075030?v=4", "stargazers": 4, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
