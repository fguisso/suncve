Prior to version 1.17.0, due to the missing sanitization of the path in the `POST /api/localsend/v2/prepare-upload` and the `POST /api/localsend/v2/upload` endpoint, a malicious file transfer request can write files to the arbitrary location on the system, resulting in the remote command execution. A malicious file transfer request sent by nearby devices can write files into an arbitrary directory. This usually allows command execution via the startup folder on Windows or Bash-related files on Linux. If the user enables the `Quick Save` feature, it will silently write files without explicit user interaction. Version 1.17.0 fixes this issue."], "published": "2025-02-25T20:15:37.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["localsend"], "productName": ["localsend"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/localsend/localsend/security/advisories/GHSA-f7jp-p6j4-3522"], "commits": ["https://github.com/localsend/localsend/commit/e8635204ec782ded45bc7d698deb60f3c4105687"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/localsend/localsend/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dart", "file-sharing", "flutter", "flutter-apps"], "langs": {"Dart": 3769282, "C++": 27866, "Swift": 27505, "Inno Setup": 24181, "CMake": 19467, "Kotlin": 18165, "PowerShell": 6731, "Shell": 4541, "HTML": 4477, "JavaScript": 4358, "Ruby": 3065, "C": 1425, "Objective-C": 38}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120677616?v=4", "stargazers": 59740, "language": "Dart"}}, "pocList": []}
