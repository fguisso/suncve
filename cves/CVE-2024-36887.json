The referenced commit\nused usleep_range inside the PHY access routines, which are sometimes\ncalled from an atomic context. This can lead to a kernel panic in some\nscenarios, such as cable disconnection and reconnection on vPro systems.\n\nSolve this by changing the usleep_range calls back to udelay."], "published": "2024-05-30T16:15:12.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
