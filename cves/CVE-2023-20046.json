An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid low-privileged SSH key to an affected device from a host that has an IP address that is configured as the source for a high-privileged user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected device through SSH as a high-privileged user.\r\n\r   There are workarounds that address this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-05-09T18:15:11.697", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software", "Cisco Ultra Cloud Core - User Plane Function"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
