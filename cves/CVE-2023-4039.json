This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "published": "2023-09-13T09:15:15.690", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Arm Ltd", "GNU"], "productName": ["Arm GNU Toolchain", "GCC"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91286942?v=4", "stargazers": 28, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
