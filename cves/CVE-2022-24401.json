IV generation is based upon several TDMA frame counters, which are frequently broadcast by the infrastructure in an unauthenticated manner. An active adversary can manipulate the view of these counters in a mobile station, provoking keystream re-use. By sending crafted messages to the MS and analyzing MS responses, keystream for arbitrary frames can be recovered."], "published": "2023-10-19T10:15:09.510", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ETSI"], "productName": ["TETRA Standard"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
