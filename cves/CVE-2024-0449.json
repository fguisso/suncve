This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."], "published": "2024-03-13T16:15:11.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["artibot"], "productName": ["ArtiBot Free Chat Bot for WordPress WebSites"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
