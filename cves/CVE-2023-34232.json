In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 1.6.21 contains a patch for this issue."], "published": "2023-06-08T21:15:17.593", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["snowflakedb"], "productName": ["snowflake-connector-nodejs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-nodejs/security/advisories/GHSA-h53w-7qw7-vh5c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-nodejs/commit/0c9622ae12cd7d627df404b73a783b4a5f60728a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-nodejs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1510957, "Shell": 21716, "Python": 5478, "Batchfile": 2430, "Dockerfile": 1184}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6453780?v=4", "stargazers": 129, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
