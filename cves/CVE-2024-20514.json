An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific page of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device."], "published": "2024-11-06T17:15:16.687", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM)", "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
