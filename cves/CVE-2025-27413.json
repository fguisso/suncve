Prior to version 1.2.0, the backup restore functionality allows an administrator to import raw data into the database, including Path Traversal (`../`) sequences. This is problematic for the template update functionality as it uses the path from the database to write arbitrary content to, potentially overwriting source code to achieve Remote Code Execution. Any user with the `backups:create`, `backups:update` and `templates:update` permissions (only administrators by default) can write arbitrary content to anywhere on the filesystem. By overwriting source code, it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution. Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue."], "published": "2025-02-28T21:15:27.820", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pwndoc"], "productName": ["pwndoc"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/security/advisories/GHSA-r3vj-47cf-4672"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/commit/68aa1ea676a91e17bfb333a27571151bd07fb21d"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/security/advisories/GHSA-r3vj-47cf-4672", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["audit", "collaboration", "infosec", "penetration-testing", "pentest", "pentesting-tool", "reporting", "reporting-tool", "security", "security-audit", "security-tool", "vulnerabilities"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1072047, "HTML": 324278, "Vue": 164816, "Stylus": 5537, "Shell": 801, "Dockerfile": 635}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59744986?v=4", "stargazers": 2464, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
