A segmentation fault occurs with ION-DTN BPv7 software version 4.1.3 when a bundle with a Destination Endpoint ID (EID) set to dtn:none is received. This causes the node to become unresponsive to incoming bundles, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.3s."], "published": "2024-12-05T16:15:27.020", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nasa-jpl"], "productName": ["ION-DTN"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ION-DTN/security/advisories/GHSA-7pj7-hfwv-q3v6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ION-DTN/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ams", "bpsec", "bpv6", "bpv7", "bundle-protocol", "cfdp", "communications", "delay-tolerant-network", "disruption-tolerant-network", "dtn", "ion", "ltp", "networking", "space"], "langs": {"C": 15673256, "HTML": 4780758, "Python": 789751, "Shell": 656459, "Java": 648170, "Makefile": 628184, "C++": 484836, "Perl": 246497, "Ruby": 130241, "JavaScript": 109482, "Lua": 90085, "CMake": 85633, "M4": 43180, "CSS": 41510, "TeX": 35510, "Batchfile": 31928, "Haskell": 13106, "Awk": 11863, "AIDL": 5274, "Roff": 3256, "QMake": 1030, "PHP": 141, "Brightscript": 20}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10360932?v=4", "stargazers": 44, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
