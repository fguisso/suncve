An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to authenticate as an admin user without needing to provide a password, thereby gaining full control of the device. (Whenever an admin logs into My Cloud, a server-side session is created that is bound to the user's IP address. After the session is created, it is possible to call authenticated CGI modules by sending the cookie username=admin in the HTTP request. The invoked CGI will check if a valid session is present and bound to the user's IP address.) It was found that it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to create a valid session without a login. The network_mgr.cgi CGI module contains a command called \"cgi_get_ipv6\" that starts an admin session -- tied to the IP address of the user making the request -- if the additional parameter \"flag\" with the value \"1\" is provided. Subsequent invocation of commands that would normally require admin privileges now succeed if an attacker sets the username=admin cookie."], "published": "2018-09-18T15:29:00.307", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
