In affected versions clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables is affected. v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the fixed versions."], "published": "2024-09-19T23:15:11.703", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["puma"], "productName": ["puma"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-9hf4-67fc-4vf4"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/puma/puma/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["multithreading", "rack", "ruby", "server"], "langs": {"Ruby": 744971, "C": 59303, "Java": 43602, "Ragel": 9223, "Shell": 9208, "PowerShell": 3326, "Dockerfile": 1455, "Lua": 127, "Batchfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1264292?v=4", "stargazers": 7745, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/ooooooo-q/puma_header_normalization-CVE-2024-45614", "https://github.com/ooooooo-q/puma_header_normalization-CVE-2024-45614"]}
