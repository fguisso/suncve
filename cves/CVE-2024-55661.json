A vulnerability has been discovered in Laravel Pulse prior to version 1.3.1 that could allow remote code execution through the public `remember()` method in the `Laravel\\Pulse\\Livewire\\Concerns\\RemembersQueries` trait. This method is accessible via Livewire components and can be exploited to call arbitrary callables within the application. An authenticated user with access to Laravel Pulse dashboard can execute arbitrary code by calling any function or static method in which the callable is a function or static method and the callable has no parameters or no strict parameter types. The vulnerable to component is `remember(callable $query, string $key = '')` method in `Laravel\\Pulse\\Livewire\\Concerns\\RemembersQueries`, and the vulnerability affects all Pulse card components that use this trait.
