The qxl_mode_dumb_create() function dereferences the qobj returned by the qxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one holding a reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returned handle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation."], "published": "2023-11-09T20:15:08.730", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
