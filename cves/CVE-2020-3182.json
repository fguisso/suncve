The vulnerability exists because sensitive information is included in the mDNS reply. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing an mDNS query for a particular service against an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information."], "published": "2020-03-04T19:15:13.307", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Webex Meetings "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
