In Nacos before version 1.4.1, when configured to use authentication (-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true) Nacos uses the AuthFilter servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter has a backdoor that enables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication checks. This mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed. This issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos server."], "published": "2021-04-27T21:15:07.993", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["alibaba"], "productName": ["nacos"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/hh-hunter/nacos-cve-2021-29441", "https://github.com/bysinks/CVE-2021-29441", "https://github.com/azhao1981/CVE-2021-29441", "https://github.com/hh-hunter/nacos-cve-2021-29441", "https://github.com/bysinks/CVE-2021-29441", "https://github.com/azhao1981/CVE-2021-29441"]}
