This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts."], "published": "2023-09-13T03:15:08.877", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mpvanwinkle77"], "productName": ["Simplr Registration Form Plus+"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
