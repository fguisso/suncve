Dataease prior to 1.15.2 has a deserialization vulnerability. In Dataease, the Mysql data source in the data source function can customize the JDBC connection parameters and the Mysql server target to be connected. In `backend/src/main/java/io/dataease/provider/datasource/JdbcProvider.java`, the `MysqlConfiguration` class does not filter any parameters. If an attacker adds some parameters to a JDBC url and connects to a malicious mysql server, the attacker can trigger the mysql jdbc deserialization vulnerability. Through the deserialization vulnerability, the attacker can execute system commands and obtain server privileges. Version 1.15.2 contains a patch for this issue."], "published": "2022-10-25T17:15:55.813", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dataease"], "productName": ["dataease"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dataease/dataease/security/advisories/GHSA-q4qq-jhjv-7rh2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/dataease/dataease/commit/956ee2d6c9e81349a60aef435efc046888e10a6d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/dataease/dataease/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["apache-doris", "business-intelligence", "data-analysis", "data-visualization", "echarts", "kettle", "superset", "tableau"], "langs": {"Java": 15486254, "Vue": 4254042, "Shell": 27269, "Lua": 22086, "Less": 12533, "Dockerfile": 952}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75054108?v=4", "stargazers": 19818, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
