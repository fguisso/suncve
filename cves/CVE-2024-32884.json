A specially crafted clone URL can smuggle options to SSH. The possibilities are syntactically limited, but if a malicious clone URL is used by an application whose current working directory contains a malicious file, arbitrary code execution occurs. This is related to the patched vulnerability GHSA-rrjw-j4m2-mf34, but appears less severe due to a greater attack complexity. This issue has been patched in versions 0.35.0, 0.42.0 and 0.62.0."], "published": "2024-04-26T18:15:46.167", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Byron"], "productName": ["gitoxide"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-98p4-xjmm-8mfh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-98p4-xjmm-8mfh", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blazingly-fast", "built-with-rust", "cli", "git", "version-control"], "langs": {"Rust": 8018145, "Shell": 648608, "HTML": 96933, "Just": 13228, "Makefile": 7129, "Dockerfile": 108}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92279517?v=4", "stargazers": 9659, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
