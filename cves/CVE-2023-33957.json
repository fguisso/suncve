An attacker who has compromised a registry and added a high number of signatures to an artifact can cause denial of service of services on the machine, if a user runs notation inspect command on the same machine. The problem has been fixed in the release v1.0.0-rc.6. Users should upgrade their notation packages to v1.0.0-rc.6 or above. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may restrict container registries to a set of secure and trusted container registries."], "published": "2023-06-06T19:15:12.363", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["notaryproject"], "productName": ["notation"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/security/advisories/GHSA-9m3v-v4r5-ppx7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/commit/ed22fde52f6d70ae0b53521bd28c9ccafa868c24"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-native", "cncf", "container", "kubernetes", "sign", "verify"], "langs": {"Go": 671241, "Shell": 21952, "Python": 7256, "Makefile": 2978}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32203186?v=4", "stargazers": 394, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
