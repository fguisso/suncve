An example situation is that an attacker could create an executable JSP file under a Tomcat web root. NOTE: the vendor's position is that there is no pgjdbc vulnerability; instead, it is a vulnerability for any application to use the pgjdbc driver with untrusted connection properties."], "published": "2022-03-10T17:47:45.810", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["java", "jdbc", "postgresql"], "langs": {"Java": 4283611, "Groovy": 20585, "Shell": 17728, "Smarty": 6366, "Kotlin": 4797, "Makefile": 2901, "Perl": 2844, "Scala": 2761, "Dockerfile": 2126}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1371956?v=4", "stargazers": 1562, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
