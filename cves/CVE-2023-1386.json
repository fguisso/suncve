When a local user in the guest writes an executable file with SUID or SGID, none of these privileged bits are correctly dropped. As a result, in rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by malicious users in the guest to elevate their privileges within the guest and help a host local user to elevate privileges on the host."], "published": "2023-07-24T16:15:11.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a", "Red Hat", "Fedora"], "productName": ["qemu", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Advanced Virtualization", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Fedora", "Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
