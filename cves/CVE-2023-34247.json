There is an open redirect in the `@keystone-6/auth` package versions 7.0.0 and prior, where the redirect leading `/` filter can be bypassed. Users may be redirected to domains other than the relative host, thereby it might be used by attackers to re-direct users to an unexpected location. To mitigate this issue, one may apply a patch from pull request 8626 or avoid using the `@keystone-6/auth` package."], "published": "2023-06-13T17:15:14.920", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["keystonejs"], "productName": ["keystone"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-jqxr-vjvv-899m"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "cms-framework", "graphql", "keystonejs", "nodejs", "react"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2216799, "JavaScript": 21500, "HTML": 5178}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6118534?v=4", "stargazers": 9496, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
