In Jupyter Server before version 1.1.1, an open redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server to redirect the browser to a different malicious website. All jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8. This is fixed in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix: \"jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/\"."], "published": "2020-12-21T18:15:15.353", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jupyter-server"], "productName": ["jupyter_server"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-9f66-54xg-pc2c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/85e4abccf6ea9321d29153f73b0bd72ccb3a6bca"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["jupyter", "server"], "langs": {"Python": 1079157, "HTML": 10136, "CSS": 1414, "JavaScript": 528}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71116660?v=4", "stargazers": 512, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
