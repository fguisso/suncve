GoCD versions 18.9.0 through 24.4.0 (inclusive) can allow GoCD admins to abuse the backup configuration \"post-backup script\" feature to potentially execute arbitrary scripts on the hosting server or container as GoCD's user, rather than pre-configured scripts. In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, as in most configurations a user who can log into the GoCD UI as an admin also has host administration permissions for the host/container that GoCD runs on, in order to manage artifact storage and other service-level configuration options. Additionally, since a GoCD admin has ability to configure and schedule pipelines tasks on all GoCD agents available to the server, the fundamental functionality of GoCD allows co-ordinated task execution similar to that of post-backup-scripts. However in restricted environments where the host administration is separated from the role of a GoCD admin, this may be unexpected. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. Post-backup scripts can no longer be executed from within certain sensitive locations on the GoCD server. No known workarounds are available."], "published": "2025-01-03T16:15:26.340", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gocd"], "productName": ["gocd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-7jr3-gh3w-vjxq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/631f315d17fcb73f310eee6c881974c9b55ca9f0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cd", "ci", "ci-cd", "continuous-delivery", "continuous-delivery-server", "continuous-deployment", "continuous-integration", "continuous-testing", "gocd", "infrastructure-as-code"], "langs": {"Java": 20217056, "TypeScript": 4425043, "Groovy": 2080374, "JavaScript": 753792, "SCSS": 565119, "Ruby": 354818, "HTML": 253794, "XSLT": 202698, "NSIS": 24216, "Shell": 15469, "FreeMarker": 13061, "EJS": 1626, "CSS": 1575, "Batchfile": 474}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6099846?v=4", "stargazers": 7213, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
