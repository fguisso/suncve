In BookStack before version 0.30.5, a user with permissions to edit a page could set certain image URL's to manipulate functionality in the exporting system, which would allow them to make server side requests and/or have access to a wider scope of files within the BookStack file storage locations. The issue was addressed in BookStack v0.30.5. As a workaround, page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade."], "published": "2020-12-09T17:15:30.477", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["BookStackApp"], "productName": ["BookStack"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-8wfc-w2r5-x7cr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bookstack", "documentation", "laravel", "php", "selfhosted", "wiki"], "langs": {"PHP": 8284458, "TypeScript": 1873399, "Blade": 456401, "JavaScript": 288502, "SCSS": 139861, "Dockerfile": 1282, "Shell": 347}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20912696?v=4", "stargazers": 16367, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
