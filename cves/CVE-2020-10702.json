A general failure of the signature generation process caused every PAuth-enforced pointer to be signed with the same signature. A local attacker could obtain the signature of a protected pointer and abuse this flaw to bypass PAuth protection for all programs running on QEMU."], "published": "2020-06-04T18:15:14.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["The QEMU Project"], "productName": ["qemu"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
