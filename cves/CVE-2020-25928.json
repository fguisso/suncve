The code does not check the \"response data length\" field of individual DNS answers, which may cause out-of-bounds read/write operations, leading to Information leak, Denial-or-Service, or Remote Code Execution, depending on the context."], "published": "2021-08-18T19:15:07.287", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
