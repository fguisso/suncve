In affected versions the Nextcloud Circles application is vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Circles application is upgraded to 0.21.3, 0.20.10 or 0.19.14 to resolve this issue. As a workaround users may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy. A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly."], "published": "2021-09-07T20:15:07.603", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nextcloud"], "productName": ["security-advisories"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-hgpq-28gj-jrj9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/circles/commit/dbb97a83ccb342c839a54f088aa19b8ba6844b0e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nextcloud/circles/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["circle", "hacktoberfest", "nextcloud", "sharing"], "langs": {"PHP": 1823351, "JavaScript": 717884, "Makefile": 3362, "Shell": 490}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19211038?v=4", "stargazers": 154, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
