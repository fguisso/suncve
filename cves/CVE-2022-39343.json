In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA."], "published": "2022-11-08T08:15:09.537", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["azure-rtos"], "productName": ["filex"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/azure-rtos/filex/security/advisories/GHSA-8jqf-wjhq-4w9f"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/filex/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 6717843, "CMake": 39301, "Shell": 1394}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61708912?v=4", "stargazers": 15, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
