When submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job` permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general). Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this specific Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case. A user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs. Fix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 and 2.1.0 "], "published": "2023-12-22T17:15:10.197", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nautobot"], "productName": ["nautobot"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-vf5m-xrhm-v999"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dcim", "hacktoberfest", "ipam", "nautobot", "network-automation", "python", "sot"], "langs": {"Python": 8362008, "HTML": 1060828, "JavaScript": 108818, "CSS": 45532, "Jinja": 28376, "Gherkin": 14390, "Dockerfile": 11222, "Shell": 8955}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75628359?v=4", "stargazers": 1167, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
