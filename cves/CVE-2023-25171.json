This makes it easier to attempt denial-of-service attacks against the Password reset page. An attacker could potentially send a large number of emails if they know the email addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally that may strain SMTP resources. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch. As potential workarounds, users may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS and/or configure rate limits on their email server when possible."], "published": "2023-02-15T15:15:11.653", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kiwitcms"], "productName": ["kiwi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-7j9h-3jxf-3vrf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/761305d04f5910ba14cc04d1255a8f1afdbb87f3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["management", "qa", "qa-team", "qatools", "testing", "testing-tools", "testlink", "testopia"], "langs": {"Python": 1059159, "HTML": 230627, "JavaScript": 171886, "Shell": 23307, "CSS": 7677, "Makefile": 5976, "Dockerfile": 2904, "RobotFramework": 1946, "Smarty": 1576, "Ruby": 1339, "Lua": 136}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31894430?v=4", "stargazers": 1020, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
