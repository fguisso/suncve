This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface inadequately validates user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a low-privileged user and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive data on the underlying database."], "published": "2023-05-18T03:15:09.900", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/redfr0g/CVE-2023-20110", "https://github.com/redfr0g/CVE-2023-20110"]}
