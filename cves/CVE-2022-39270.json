Users that can create topics in TOC-enabled categories (and have sufficient trust level - configured in component's settings) are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that topic's page. The issue has been fixed on the `main` branch. Admins can update the theme component through the admin UI (Customize -> Themes -> Components -> DiscoTOC -> Check for Updates). Alternatively, admins can temporarily disable the DiscoTOC theme component."], "published": "2022-10-06T18:16:14.227", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["DiscoTOC"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/DiscoTOC/security/advisories/GHSA-m44p-w923-w32h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/discourse/DiscoTOC/commit/f80c215a283cd045d2a371403e6eba88b2911192"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/DiscoTOC/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["discourse-theme-component"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 21826, "Ruby": 13827, "SCSS": 6070, "Handlebars": 227}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 23, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
