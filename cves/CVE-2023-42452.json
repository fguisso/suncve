In versions on the 4.x branch prior to versions 4.0.10, 4.2.8, and 4.2.0-rc2, under certain conditions, attackers can abuse the translation feature to bypass the server-side HTML sanitization, allowing unescaped HTML to execute in the browser. The impact is limited thanks to Mastodon's strict Content Security Policy, blocking inline scripts, etc. However a CSP bypass or loophole could be exploited to execute malicious XSS. Furthermore, it requires user interaction, as this can only occur upon clicking the “Translate” button on a malicious post. Versions 4.0.10, 4.2.8, and 4.2.0-rc2 contain a patch for this issue."], "published": "2023-09-19T16:15:13.630", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mastodon"], "productName": ["mastodon"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-2693-xr3m-jhqr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/ff32475f5f4a84ebf9619e7eef5bf8b4c075d0e2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["activity-stream", "activitypub", "docker", "fediverse", "mastodon", "microblog", "social-network", "social-web", "webfinger"], "langs": {"Ruby": 4801967, "JavaScript": 1126426, "TypeScript": 783059, "SCSS": 343545, "Haml": 327812, "Dockerfile": 18562, "HTML": 13731, "Shell": 2288, "Procfile": 911, "CSS": 51}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24979032?v=4", "stargazers": 48060, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
