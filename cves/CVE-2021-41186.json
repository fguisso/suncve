The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd)."], "published": "2021-10-29T14:15:07.730", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fluent"], "productName": ["fluentd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-hwhf-64mh-r662"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cncf", "data-collector", "fluentd", "logging", "ruby"], "langs": {"Ruby": 3405093, "HTML": 7515}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/859518?v=4", "stargazers": 13095, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
