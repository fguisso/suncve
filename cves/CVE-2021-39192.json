An error in the implementation of the limits service between versions 4.0.0 and 4.9.4 allows all authenticated users (including contributors) to view admin-level API keys via the integrations API endpoint, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability. This issue is patched in Ghost version 4.10.0. As a workaround, disable all non-Administrator accounts to prevent API access. It is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after patching or applying the workaround."], "published": "2021-09-03T15:15:09.410", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["TryGhost"], "productName": ["Ghost"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/security/advisories/GHSA-j5c2-hm46-wp5c"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blogging", "cms", "creator-economy", "ghost", "hacktoberfest", "headless-cms", "jamstack", "javascript", "journalism", "nodejs", "publishing", "web-application"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 12907345, "TypeScript": 3075244, "CSS": 1160291, "Handlebars": 957600, "HTML": 300349, "Shell": 25720, "MDX": 24672, "XSLT": 6522, "Dockerfile": 5648}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2178663?v=4", "stargazers": 48904, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
