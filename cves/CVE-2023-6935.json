The vulnerability is specific to static RSA cipher suites, and expected to be padding-independent.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt ciphertexts and forge signatures after probing with a large number of test observations. However the server’s private key is not exposed.\n"], "published": "2024-02-09T23:15:08.030", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wolfSSL"], "productName": ["wolfSSL"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
