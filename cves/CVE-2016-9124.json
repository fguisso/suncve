The login page of Revive Adserver is vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. An account lockdown feature was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing service disruptions to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead been introduced as a countermeasure in case of password failures, along with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack is in progress."], "published": "2017-03-28T02:59:00.323", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Revive Adserver All versions before 3.2.3"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/847941390f5b3310d51b07c92ec91cc1f4cc82c9"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 27483082, "JavaScript": 1095380, "HTML": 1041508, "CSS": 237772, "XSLT": 130214, "Smarty": 7889, "Shell": 7459}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5091572?v=4", "stargazers": 1311, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
