The vulnerability is due to improper resource management for UDP ingress packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of UDP packets to an affected system within a short period of time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available system resources, resulting in a DoS condition."], "published": "2019-01-23T23:29:00.620", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
