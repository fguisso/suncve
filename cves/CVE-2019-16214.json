For example, a Move module author can enter the // sequence (which introduces a single-line comment), followed by very brief comment text, the \\r character, and code that has security-critical functionality. In many popular environments, this code is displayed on a separate line, and thus a reader may infer that the code is executed. However, the code is NOT executed, because language/compiler/ir_to_bytecode/src/parser.rs allows the comment to continue after the \\r character."], "published": "2019-09-11T04:15:11.887", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/libra/libra/commit/7efb0221989f17fdf7f8486730898ed947a1e19e"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/libra/libra/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blockchain"], "langs": {"Rust": 18411652, "JavaScript": 434443, "SMT": 262895, "CSS": 109692, "Shell": 102217, "TeX": 87160, "Boogie": 44693, "Dockerfile": 20713, "Python": 18840, "Java": 3939, "C#": 3791, "Mustache": 3775, "Go": 2314, "Jupyter Notebook": 2124, "C++": 1538, "Smarty": 1049, "HTML": 231}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48265171?v=4", "stargazers": 16699, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
