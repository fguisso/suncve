A rogue server could return a malicious frame header that leads to a smaller target_size value than needed. This condition is then carried on to a memcpy function that copies too much data into a heap buffer."], "published": "2019-12-01T22:15:10.897", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/commit/fc85be7123050b91b054e45b91c78d3241a5047a"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["rabbitmq", "rabbitmq-client"], "langs": {"C": 499623, "CMake": 24967, "Python": 22100, "Shell": 5704, "Dockerfile": 785}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439940?v=4", "stargazers": 1807, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
