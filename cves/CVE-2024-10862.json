This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This can be exploited via CSRF due to a lack of nonce validation on the get_table_records AJAX action."], "published": "2024-12-25T07:15:11.190", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["webaways"], "productName": ["NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder – Contact forms and much more"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
