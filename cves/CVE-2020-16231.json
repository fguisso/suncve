Affected controllers that are actively supported include MX207, MX213, MX220, MC206, MC212, MC220, and MH230 hardware controllers, and affected end-of-life controller include MC205, MC210, MH212, ME203, CS200, MP213, MP226, MPC240, MPC265, MPC270, MPC293, MPE270, and CPC210 hardware controllers. Security Level 0 is set at default from the manufacturer, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain access to the password hashes. Security Level 4 is susceptible if an authenticated remote attacker or an unauthenticated person with physical access to the device reads and decrypts the password to conduct further attacks."], "published": "2022-05-19T18:15:08.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Bachmann Electronic, GmbH"], "productName": ["M1 Hardware Controller MX207", "M1 Hardware Controller MX213", "M1 Hardware Controller MX220", "M1 Hardware Controller MC206", "M1 Hardware Controller MC212", "M1 Hardware Controller MC220", "M1 Hardware Controller MH230", "M1 Hardware Controller MC205", "M1 Hardware Controller MC210", "M1 Hardware Controller MH212", "M1 Hardware Controller ME203", "M1 Hardware Controller CS200", "M1 Hardware Controller MP213", "M1 Hardware Controller MP226", "M1 Hardware Controller MPC240", "M1 Hardware Controller MPC265", "M1 Hardware Controller MPC270", "M1 Hardware Controller MPC293", "M1 Hardware Controller MPE270", "M1 Hardware Controller CPC210"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
