In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/login` in ZimaOS returns distinct responses based on whether a username exists or the password is incorrect. This behavior can be exploited for username enumeration, allowing attackers to determine whether a user exists in the system or not. Attackers can leverage this information in further attacks, such as credential stuffing or targeted password brute-forcing. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available."], "published": "2024-10-24T22:15:04.083", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["IceWhaleTech"], "productName": ["ZimaOS"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-3f6g-8r88-3mx5"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-3f6g-8r88-3mx5", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Shell": 1021}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91336243?v=4", "stargazers": 1227, "language": "Shell"}}, "pocList": []}
