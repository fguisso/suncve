The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system to exploit this vulnerability."], "published": "2022-08-25T18:15:10.363", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["kernel"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
