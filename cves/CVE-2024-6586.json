A dashboard that contains HTML elements which point to a threat actor controlled source can trigger an SSRF request when exported, via a POST request to /api/v1/dashboards//export. The forged request contains the value of the exporting userâ€™s session token. A threat actor could obtain the session token of any user who exports the dashboard. The obtained session token can be used to perform actions as the victim on the application, resulting in session takeover."], "published": "2024-08-30T23:15:12.747", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Lightdash"], "productName": ["Lightdash"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-4h7x-6vxh-7hjf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-4h7x-6vxh-7hjf", "kw": ["proof of concept", "steps:", "reproduction steps"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/google/security-research/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 3261224, "Python": 153144, "Shell": 123520, "Go": 122474, "TypeScript": 84926, "Makefile": 59334, "Assembly": 49813, "Java": 31234, "CSS": 23622, "CodeQL": 18092, "Dockerfile": 13547, "HTML": 6938, "C++": 6653, "JavaScript": 3944, "GDB": 811, "PHP": 556}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342004?v=4", "stargazers": 3851, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
