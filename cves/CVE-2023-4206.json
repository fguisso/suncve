This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8.\n\n"], "published": "2023-09-06T14:15:11.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Kernel"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/hshivhare67/Kernel_4.1.15_CVE-2023-4206_CVE-2023-4207_CVE-2023-4208", "https://github.com/hshivhare67/Kernel_4.1.15_CVE-2023-4206_CVE-2023-4207_CVE-2023-4208"]}
