Prior to versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, and 010.0, there is a hard-coded cryptographic key in the code base which can be exploited to run admin commands on a remote server if the exploiter know the address and username of the admin. This effects the server (netmaker) component, and not clients. This has been patched in Netmaker v0.8.5, v0.9.4, and v0.10.0. There are currently no known workarounds."], "published": "2022-02-18T22:15:13.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gravitl"], "productName": ["netmaker"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/security/advisories/GHSA-86f3-hf24-76q4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/commit/3d4f44ecfe8be4ca38920556ba3b90502ffb4fee", "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/commit/e9bce264719f88c30e252ecc754d08f422f4c080"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud", "devsecops", "k8s", "kubernetes", "mesh", "mesh-network", "network", "networking", "overlay-network", "security", "self-hosted", "virtual-network", "virtual-networking", "vpn", "vpn-server", "wg-quick", "wireguard", "wireguard-ui", "wireguard-vpn", "zero-trust"], "langs": {"Go": 1128285, "Shell": 83940, "Dockerfile": 501}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81370672?v=4", "stargazers": 10014, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
