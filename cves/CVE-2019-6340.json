This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution in some cases. A site is only affected by this if one of the following conditions is met: The site has the Drupal 8 core RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled and allows PATCH or POST requests, or the site has another web services module enabled, like JSON:API in Drupal 8, or Services or RESTful Web Services in Drupal 7. (Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself does not require an update at this time, but you should apply other contributed updates associated with this advisory if Services is in use.)"], "published": "2019-02-21T21:29:00.343", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Drupal"], "productName": ["Drupal Core"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/g0rx/Drupal-SA-CORE-2019-003", "https://github.com/knqyf263/CVE-2019-6340", "https://github.com/DevDungeon/CVE-2019-6340-Drupal-8.6.9-REST-Auth-Bypass", "https://github.com/oways/CVE-2019-6340", "https://github.com/cved-sources/cve-2019-6340", "https://github.com/josehelps/cve-2019-6340-bits", "https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-6340", "https://github.com/ludy-dev/drupal8-REST-RCE", "https://github.com/nobodyatall648/CVE-2019-6340", "https://github.com/Sumitpathania03/Drupal-cve-2019-6340", "https://github.com/g0rx/Drupal-SA-CORE-2019-003", "https://github.com/knqyf263/CVE-2019-6340", "https://github.com/DevDungeon/CVE-2019-6340-Drupal-8.6.9-REST-Auth-Bypass", "https://github.com/oways/CVE-2019-6340", "https://github.com/cved-sources/cve-2019-6340", "https://github.com/josehelps/cve-2019-6340-bits", "https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-6340", "https://github.com/ludy-dev/drupal8-REST-RCE", "https://github.com/nobodyatall648/CVE-2019-6340", "https://github.com/Sumitpathania03/Drupal-cve-2019-6340"]}
