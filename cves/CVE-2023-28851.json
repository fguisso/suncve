Starting in version 0.2.0 and prior to versions 1.0.2, 1.1.0, 2.2.5, and 3.1.1, improper escaping when presenting stored form submissions allowed for an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack. The vulnerability was initially patched in version 1.0.2, and version 1.1.0 includes this patch. The bug was then accidentally re-introduced during a merge error, and has been re-patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-04-03T18:15:07.927", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["bigfork"], "productName": ["silverstripe-form-capture"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/security/advisories/GHSA-38h6-gmr2-j4wx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/commit/5b3aa39dd1eef042f173167b0fa4d3f717971772"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 24732}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2963491?v=4", "stargazers": 1, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
