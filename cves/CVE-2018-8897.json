The MOV to SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory accessed by the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction itself.) Note that debug exceptions are not inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system flag (SDM Vol. 3A; section 2.3). If the instruction following the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction is an instruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control to the operating system at CPL < 3, the debug exception is delivered after the transfer to CPL < 3 is complete. OS kernels may not expect this order of events and may therefore experience unexpected behavior when it occurs."], "published": "2018-05-08T18:29:00.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d8ba61ba58c88d5207c1ba2f7d9a2280e7d03be9"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/torvalds/linux/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 1348363240, "Assembly": 9632676, "Shell": 5140958, "Python": 3111393, "Makefile": 2734946, "Perl": 1223890, "Rust": 1035407, "Roff": 203501, "C++": 179456, "SmPL": 166781, "Yacc": 128635, "Lex": 72476, "Awk": 71808, "Jinja": 30138, "UnrealScript": 16878, "Gherkin": 10932, "Linker Script": 9830, "M4": 3329, "Clojure": 2621, "MATLAB": 2482, "sed": 2433, "XS": 1239, "RPC": 962}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1024025?v=4", "stargazers": 191042, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/nmulasmajic/CVE-2018-8897", "https://github.com/jiazhang0/pop-mov-ss-exploit", "https://github.com/can1357/CVE-2018-8897", "https://github.com/nmulasmajic/syscall_exploit_CVE-2018-8897", "https://github.com/nmulasmajic/CVE-2018-8897", "https://github.com/jiazhang0/pop-mov-ss-exploit", "https://github.com/can1357/CVE-2018-8897", "https://github.com/nmulasmajic/syscall_exploit_CVE-2018-8897"]}
