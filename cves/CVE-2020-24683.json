Therefore, if the network communication or endpoints for these applications are not protected, unauthorized actors can bypass authentication and make unauthorized connections to the server application."], "published": "2020-12-22T22:15:13.757", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ABB"], "productName": ["ABB Ability™ Symphony® Plus Operations"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
