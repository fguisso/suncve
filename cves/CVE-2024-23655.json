Starting in version 3.118.12 and prior to version 3.119.10, an attacker is able to send a manipulated email so that the user can no longer use the app to get access to received emails. By sending a manipulated email, an attacker could put the app into an unusable state. In this case, a user can no longer access received e-mails. Since the vulnerability affects not only the app, but also the web application, a user in this case has no way to access received emails. This issue was tested with iOS and the web app, but it is possible all clients are affected. Version 3.119.10 fixes this issue."], "published": "2024-01-25T20:15:40.913", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tutao"], "productName": ["tutanota"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/security/advisories/GHSA-5h47-g927-629g"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/security/advisories/GHSA-5h47-g927-629g", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["email", "encryption", "javascript", "mithril", "privacy", "security", "tutanota"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 15341339, "C": 9955618, "Rust": 1183897, "JavaScript": 948755, "Kotlin": 667513, "Swift": 523873, "HTML": 83483, "Shell": 27571, "Groovy": 20210, "Ruby": 13839, "C++": 12419, "Objective-C": 10583, "OMNeT++ MSG": 4958, "CMake": 2714, "Dockerfile": 2144, "Java": 1983, "NSIS": 980, "RenderScript": 1}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6120691?v=4", "stargazers": 6483, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
