The week view plugin in Time Tracker versions 1.22.11.5782 and prior was not escaping titles for notes in week view table. Because of that, it was possible for a logged in user to enter notes with elements of JavaScript. Such script could then be executed in user browser on subsequent requests to week view. This issue is fixed in version 1.22.12.5783. As a workaround, use `htmlspecialchars` when calling `$field->setTitle` on line #245 in the `week.php` file,  as happens in version 1.22.12.5783."], "published": "2023-05-09T16:15:15.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["anuko"], "productName": ["timetracker"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-jw2g-8wvp-9frw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/093cfe158099704ffd4a1624be217f9935e914eb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 5951736, "Smarty": 314330, "JavaScript": 30090, "CSS": 16132, "Batchfile": 13672, "Shell": 2274}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2672997?v=4", "stargazers": 192, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
