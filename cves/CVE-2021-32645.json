In some situations, it is possible to have open redirects where users can be redirected from your site to any other site using a specially crafted URL. This is only the case for installations where the default Hostname Identification is used and the environment uses tenants that have `force_https` set to `true` (default: `false`). Version 5.7.2 contains the relevant patches to fix this bug. Stripping the URL from special characters to prevent specially crafted URL's from being redirected to. As a work around users can set the `force_https` to every tenant to `false`, however this may degrade connection security."], "published": "2021-05-27T17:15:08.127", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tenancy"], "productName": ["multi-tenant"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant/security/advisories/GHSA-4r8q-gv9j-3xx6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant/commit/9c837a21bccce9bcaeb90033ef200d84f0d9e164"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "laravel", "multi-domain", "multi-tenancy", "multi-tenant", "saas", "tenancy", "tenant"], "langs": {"PHP": 315360, "Blade": 2824, "Shell": 1872}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33319474?v=4", "stargazers": 2580, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
