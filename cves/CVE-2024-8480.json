This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to exploit the 'sirv_upload_file_by_chunks_callback' function, which lacks proper file type validation, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible."], "published": "2024-09-06T04:15:05.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sirv"], "productName": ["Image Optimizer, Resizer and CDN – Sirv"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
