When a user requests the content of a file with a misspelled name, the agent attempts to correct the command and inadvertently reveals the content of the intended file, such as /etc/passwd. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential server compromise."], "published": "2024-07-03T18:15:05.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stitionai"], "productName": ["stitionai/devika"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
