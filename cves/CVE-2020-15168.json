For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after fetch() has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing."], "published": "2020-09-10T19:15:13.490", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["node-fetch"], "productName": ["node-fetch"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/security/advisories/GHSA-w7rc-rwvf-8q5r"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["fetch", "fetch-api", "hacktoberfest", "http", "http-client", "node-fetch", "promise", "spec-compliant", "stream", "whatwg", "whatwg-fetch"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 199878, "TypeScript": 3341}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59502381?v=4", "stargazers": 8835, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
