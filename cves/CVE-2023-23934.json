Browsers may allow \"nameless\" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as __Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key. The issue is fixed in Werkzeug 2.2.3."], "published": "2023-02-14T20:15:17.370", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pallets"], "productName": ["werkzeug"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/cf275f42acad1b5950c50ffe8ef58fe62cdce028"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["http", "pallets", "python", "werkzeug", "wsgi"], "langs": {"Python": 1061077, "JavaScript": 10068, "CSS": 6078, "Shell": 165, "HTML": 124}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16748505?v=4", "stargazers": 6734, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
