This can lead to a out-of-bound write further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's conceivable that an attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata."], "published": "2023-07-20T01:15:10.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["GNU Project"], "productName": ["GNU GRUB"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
