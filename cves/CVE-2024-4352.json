The plugin is also vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘year’ parameter of that function due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."], "published": "2024-05-16T10:15:10.470", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["themium"], "productName": ["Tutor LMS Pro"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/truonghuuphuc/CVE-2024-4352-Poc", "https://github.com/truonghuuphuc/CVE-2024-4352-Poc"]}
