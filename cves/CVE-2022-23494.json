A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the alert and confirm dialogs when these dialogs were provided with malicious HTML content. This can occur in plugins that use the alert or confirm dialogs, such as in the `image` plugin, which presents these dialogs when certain errors occur. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an alert presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.7 and TinyMCE 6.3.1 by ensuring HTML sanitization was still performed after unwrapping invalid elements. Users are advised to upgrade to either 5.10.7 or 6.3.1. Users unable to upgrade may ensure the the `images_upload_handler` returns a valid value as per the images_upload_handler documentation."], "published": "2022-12-08T22:15:10.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tinymce"], "productName": ["tinymce"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-gg8r-xjwq-4w92"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/commit/6923d85eba6de3e08ebc9c5a387b5abdaa21150e", "https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/commit/8bb2d2646d4e1a718fce61a775fa22e9d317b32d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["contenteditable", "editor", "javascript", "rich-text-editor", "tinymce", "wysiwyg", "wysiwyg-editor", "wysiwyg-html-editor"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 14028523, "HTML": 368076, "Less": 258750, "JavaScript": 123008, "CSS": 9733, "Makefile": 1427}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119815?v=4", "stargazers": 15434, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
