This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account."], "published": "2024-10-26T09:15:04.900", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jdsofttech"], "productName": ["School Management System – WPSchoolPress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
