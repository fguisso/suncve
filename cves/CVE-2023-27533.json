The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent. This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system."], "published": "2023-03-30T20:15:07.373", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["https://github.com/curl/curl"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
