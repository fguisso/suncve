In affected versions a bug in Astroâ€™s CSRF-protection middleware allows requests to bypass CSRF checks. When the `security.checkOrigin` configuration option is set to `true`, Astro middleware will perform a CSRF check. However, a vulnerability exists that can bypass this security. A semicolon-delimited parameter is allowed after the type in `Content-Type`. Web browsers will treat a `Content-Type` such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; abc` as a `simple request` and will not perform preflight validation. In this case, CSRF is not blocked as expected. Additionally, the `Content-Type` header is not required for a request. This issue has been addressed in version 4.16.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-12-18T21:15:08.353", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["withastro"], "productName": ["astro"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/withastro/astro/security/advisories/GHSA-c4pw-33h3-35xw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/e7d14c374b9d45e27089994a4eb72186d05514de"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/withastro/astro/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["astro", "blog", "browser", "components", "hybrid", "islands", "node", "server", "static", "static-site-generator", "universal"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2383892, "JavaScript": 1844742, "Astro": 146149, "CSS": 8517, "Vue": 7948, "Svelte": 5814, "MDX": 5673, "Shell": 943, "Dockerfile": 682, "Roff": 630, "SCSS": 13}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44914786?v=4", "stargazers": 50272, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
