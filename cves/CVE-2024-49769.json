When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername() waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition."], "published": "2024-10-29T15:15:12.030", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Pylons"], "productName": ["waitress"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-3f84-rpwh-47g6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/1ae4e894c9f76543bee06584001583fc6fa8c95c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["http-server", "python", "wsgi-server"], "langs": {"Python": 495249}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/452227?v=4", "stargazers": 1489, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
