An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring the application in a way that causes a malicious file to be executed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device as the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid credentials on an affected device."], "published": "2024-05-15T18:15:09.440", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Network Services Orchestrator"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
