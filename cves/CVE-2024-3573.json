The issue arises from the 'is_local_uri' function's failure to properly handle URIs with empty or 'file' schemes, leading to the misclassification of URIs as non-local. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious model versions with specially crafted 'source' parameters, enabling the reading of sensitive files within at least two directory levels from the server's root."], "published": "2024-04-16T00:15:12.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mlflow"], "productName": ["mlflow/mlflow"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/438a450714a3ca06285eeea34bdc6cf79d7f6cbc"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "apache-spark", "machine-learning", "ml", "mlflow", "model-management"], "langs": {"Python": 13420900, "TypeScript": 4295123, "JavaScript": 2810964, "Java": 290984, "R": 211831, "Scala": 42315, "Shell": 38946, "HTML": 31852, "CSS": 22828, "Dockerfile": 1312, "Mako": 1004, "TSQL": 211}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39938107?v=4", "stargazers": 20047, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
