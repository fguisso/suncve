The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of certain broadcast packets ingress to the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large streams of broadcast packets to an affected device. If successful, an exploit could allow an attacker to impact services running on the device, resulting in a partial DoS condition."], "published": "2019-01-11T15:29:00.247", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Routers "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
