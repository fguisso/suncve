When Squid is parsing ESI, it keeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement. addStackElement has a check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it's off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can't affect adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing."], "published": "2020-04-15T19:15:12.393", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
