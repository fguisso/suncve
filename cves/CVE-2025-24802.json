Lookup tables, whose length is not divisible by 26 = floor(num_routed_wires / 3) always include the 0 -> 0 input-output pair. Thus a malicious prover can always prove that f(0) = 0 for any lookup table f (unless its length happens to be divisible by 26). The cause of problem is that the LookupTableGate-s are padded with zeros. A workaround from the user side is to extend the table (by repeating some entries) so that its length becomes divisible by 26. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1."], "published": "2025-01-30T20:15:51.010", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["0xPolygonZero"], "productName": ["plonky2"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2/security/advisories/GHSA-hj49-h7fq-px5h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2/commit/091047f7f10cae082716f3738ad59a583835f7b6"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 1640153, "Python": 9329, "HTML": 1563, "Shell": 1002, "RenderScript": 1}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42745186?v=4", "stargazers": 811, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
