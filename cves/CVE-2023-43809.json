Prior to version 0.6.2, a security vulnerability in Soft Serve could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass public key authentication when keyboard-interactive SSH authentication is active, through the `allow-keyless` setting, and the public key requires additional client-side verification for example using FIDO2 or GPG. This is due to insufficient validation procedures of the public key step during SSH request handshake, granting unauthorized access if the keyboard-interaction mode is utilized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting manipulated SSH requests using keyboard-interactive authentication mode. This could potentially result in unauthorized access to the Soft Serve. Users should upgrade to the latest Soft Serve version `v0.6.2` to receive the patch for this issue. To workaround this vulnerability without upgrading, users can temporarily disable Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication using the `allow-keyless` setting."], "published": "2023-10-04T21:15:10.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["charmbracelet"], "productName": ["soft-serve"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/security/advisories/GHSA-mc97-99j4-vm2v"], "commits": ["https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/commit/407c4ec72d1006cee1ff8c1775e5bcc091c2bc89"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["git", "golang", "ssh"], "langs": {"Go": 628404, "Dockerfile": 574, "Shell": 510}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57376114?v=4", "stargazers": 5788, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
