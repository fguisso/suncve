This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes."], "published": "2024-11-09T12:15:16.800", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["madalinungureanu"], "productName": ["Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
