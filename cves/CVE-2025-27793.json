In Vega prior to version 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions prior to version 5.17.0, users running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected JavaScript code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the `vega-interpreter`. Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0 fix the issue.
