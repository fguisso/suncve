If user-supplied input was passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a semicolon could be injected leading to directive injection. This could be used to e.g. override a script-src directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and the first one wins. The directives in secure_headers are sorted alphabetically so they pretty much all come before script-src. A previously undefined directive would receive a value even if SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT was supplied. The fixed versions will silently convert the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning when this happens. This will result in innocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally used. In future releases, we will raise application errors resulting in 500s. Depending on what major version you are using, the fixed versions are 6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0."], "published": "2020-01-23T03:15:10.793", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Twitter"], "productName": ["secure_headers"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/twitter/secure_headers/security/advisories/GHSA-xq52-rv6w-397c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/twitter/secure_headers/commit/936a160e3e9659737a9f9eafce13eea36b5c9fa3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/twitter/secure_headers/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["content-security-policy", "cookie", "csp", "hsts", "middleware", "rack", "referrer-policy", "ruby", "secure-headers", "xframe-options"], "langs": {"Ruby": 161206}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4", "stargazers": 3169, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
