Prior to version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections, the `vlSelectionTuples` function can be used to call JavaScript functions, leading to cross-site scripting.`vlSelectionTuples` calls multiple functions that can be controlled by an attacker, including one call with an attacker-controlled argument. This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`. Version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections fix this issue."], "published": "2025-02-14T20:15:36.903", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vega"], "productName": ["vega"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-mp7w-mhcv-673j"], "commits": ["https://github.com/vega/vega/commit/9fb9ea07e27984394e463d286eb73944fa61411e"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-mp7w-mhcv-673j", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/vega/vega/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["canvas", "d3", "svg", "vega", "visualization", "visualization-grammar"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1463685, "TypeScript": 481449, "HTML": 21704, "Shell": 3433}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11796929?v=4", "stargazers": 11434, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
