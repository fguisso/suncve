When using the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, some internal information is still leaking during host resolution, which leads to possible IP/port enumeration. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` now filters blocked IPs earlier to prevent such leaks. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-11-06T21:15:05.963", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["symfony"], "productName": ["symfony"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-9c3x-r3wp-mgxm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/296d4b34a33b1a6ca5475c6040b3203622520f5b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bundle", "framework", "hacktoberfest", "php", "php-framework", "symfony", "symfony-bundle"], "langs": {"PHP": 30987251, "Twig": 526600, "CSS": 56186, "JavaScript": 28225, "HTML": 16804, "Shell": 9654, "Makefile": 1612, "Hack": 26}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143937?v=4", "stargazers": 30255, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
