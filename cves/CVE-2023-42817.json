The translation value with text including “%s” (from “%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf() even though it’s supposed to be output literally to the user. The translations may be accessible by a user with comparatively lower overall access (as the translation permission cannot be scoped to certain “modules”) and a skilled attacker might be able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the dialog box. This issue has been patched in commit `abd77392` which is included in release 1.1.2. Users are advised to update to version 1.1.2 or apply the patch manually.\n"], "published": "2023-09-25T19:15:10.493", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pimcore"], "productName": ["admin-ui-classic-bundle"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/security/advisories/GHSA-m988-7375-7g2c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/abd7739298f974319e3cac3fd4fcd7f995b63e4c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3783679, "PHP": 1375309, "CSS": 817971, "Twig": 120193, "SCSS": 10777, "Shell": 409}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/686745?v=4", "stargazers": 14, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
