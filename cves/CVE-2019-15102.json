TestRunner_Non_distributed (and distributed end points) does not have any authentication mechanism. This allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary script on the remote Sahi Pro server. There is also a password-protected web interface intended for remote access to scripts. This web interface lacks server-side validation, which allows an attacker to create/modify/delete a script remotely without any password. Chaining both of these issues results in remote code execution on the Sahi Pro server."], "published": "2019-09-06T17:15:11.620", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
