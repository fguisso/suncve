A possible timing attack could be carried out by modifying a PKCS#12 file that has an integrity MAC for which the password is not known. An attacker could then feed the modified PKCS#12 file to the toolkit and guess the current MAC one byte at a time. This is possible because Crypto-J uses a non-constant-time method to compare the stored MAC with the calculated MAC. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-2601."], "published": "2017-02-03T07:59:00.437", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["RSA BSAFE Crypto-J RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to 6.2.2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
