This exploit exists due to an incomplete fix that was made when this vulnerability was previously disclosed as CVE-2020-35476. Regex validation that was implemented to restrict allowed input to the query API does not work as intended, allowing crafted commands to bypass validation.\n\n"], "published": "2023-05-03T19:15:08.963", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenTSDB"], "productName": ["OpenTSDB"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
