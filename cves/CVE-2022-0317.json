Subsequent use of the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker could couple this vulnerability with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof events in the TCG log, hence defeating remotely-attested measured-boot. We recommend upgrading to Version 0.4.0 or above."], "published": "2022-02-04T23:15:12.510", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Google LLC"], "productName": ["go-attestation"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/google/go-attestation/security/advisories/GHSA-99cg-575x-774p"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/google/go-attestation/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 384308, "Shell": 7478}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342004?v=4", "stargazers": 380, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
