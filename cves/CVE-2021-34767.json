The vulnerability is due to a logic error when processing specific link-local IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet that would flow inbound through the wired interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic drops in the affected VLAN, thus triggering the DoS condition."], "published": "2021-09-23T03:15:20.180", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XE Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/lukejenkins/CVE-2021-34767", "https://github.com/lukejenkins/CVE-2021-34767"]}
