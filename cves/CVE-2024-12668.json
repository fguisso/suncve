In conjunction with information leakage from the WinPmem driver, attackers can discover the location in memory for the  g_CiOptions global symbol. This can be leveraged to disable signed driver enforcement on the target system - allowing attackers to load unsigned drivers."], "published": "2024-12-16T15:15:06.807", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Velocidex"], "productName": ["WinPmem"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
