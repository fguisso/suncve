Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0."], "published": "2024-05-14T15:39:31.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["directus"], "productName": ["directus"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-g65h-35f3-x2w3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/a6172f8a6a0f31a6bf4305a090de172ebfb63bcf"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-g65h-35f3-x2w3", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/directus/directus/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "app", "cms", "composable", "data-visualization", "database", "directus", "graphql", "headless-cms", "javascript", "mariadb", "mssql", "mysql", "no-code", "node", "postgresql", "sql", "sqlite", "typescript", "vue"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5215942, "Vue": 1905810, "SCSS": 58308, "Liquid": 28677, "CSS": 27226, "JavaScript": 26886, "Dockerfile": 2044, "HTML": 1189}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15967950?v=4", "stargazers": 29818, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
