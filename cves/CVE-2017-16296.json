In cmd s_schd, at 0x9d01a1d4, the value for the `days` key is copied using `strcpy` to the buffer at `$sp+0x2b0`.This buffer is 32 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow."], "published": "2023-01-11T22:15:12.370", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Insteon"], "productName": ["Hub"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
