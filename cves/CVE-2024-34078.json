If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization. The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.\n"], "published": "2024-05-06T15:15:24.187", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matthiask"], "productName": ["html-sanitizer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matthiask/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-wvhx-q427-fgh3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matthiask/html-sanitizer/commit/48db42fc5143d0140c32d929c46b802f96913550"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matthiask/html-sanitizer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 40847}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2627?v=4", "stargazers": 141, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
