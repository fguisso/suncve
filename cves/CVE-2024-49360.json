An authenticated user (**UserA**) with no privileges is authorized to read all files created in sandbox belonging to other users in the sandbox folders `C:\\Sandbox\\UserB\\xxx`. An authenticated attacker who can use `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe` outside any sandbox can read other users' files in `C:\\Sandbox\\xxx`. By default in Windows 7+, the `C:\\Users\\UserA` folder is not readable by **UserB**.\nAll files edited or created during the sandbox processing are affected by the vulnerability. All files in C:\\Users are safe. If `UserB` runs a cmd in a sandbox, he will be able to access `C:\\Sandox\\UserA`. In addition, if **UserB** create a folder `C:\\Sandbox\\UserA` with malicious ACLs, when **UserA** will user the sandbox, Sandboxie doesn't reset ACLs ! This issue has not yet been fixed. Users are advised to limit access to their systems using Sandboxie."], "published": "2024-11-29T18:15:09.307", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sandboxie-plus"], "productName": ["Sandboxie"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/security/advisories/GHSA-4chj-3c28-gvmp"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/security/advisories/GHSA-4chj-3c28-gvmp", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 5911706, "C++": 5332224, "Assembly": 1008943, "Inno Setup": 174233, "HTML": 167277, "NSIS": 67239, "Batchfile": 38930, "JavaScript": 24004, "QMake": 20844, "CSS": 3883, "Makefile": 3248}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63755826?v=4", "stargazers": 14811, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
