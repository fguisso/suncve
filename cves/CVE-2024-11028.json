This is due to the user impersonation feature inappropriately determining the current user via user-supplied input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate an impersonation link that will allow them to log in as any existing user, such as an administrator. NOTE: The user impersonation feature was disabled in version 1.1.0 and re-enabled with a patch in version 1.1.2."], "published": "2024-11-13T10:15:04.237", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["icdsoft"], "productName": ["MultiManager WP – Manage All Your WordPress Sites Easily"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
