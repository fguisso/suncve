This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts via the 'option' parameter in the POST request to /phpipam/app/admin/circuits/edit-options-submit.php. The injected script can be executed in the context of the user's browser, leading to potential cookie theft and end-user file disclosure.
