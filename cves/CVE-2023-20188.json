An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.\r\n\r Cisco has not released software updates to address this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-06-28T15:15:09.943", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Small Business Smart and Managed Switches"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
