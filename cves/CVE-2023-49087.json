Validation of an XML signature requires verification that the hash value of the related XML-document matches a specific DigestValue-value, but also that the cryptographic signature on the SignedInfo-tree (the one that contains the DigestValue) verifies and matches a trusted public key. If an attacker somehow (i.e. by exploiting a bug in PHP's canonicalization function) manages to manipulate the canonicalized version's DigestValue, it would be possible to forge the signature. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.12 and 5.0.0-alpha.13."], "published": "2023-11-30T06:15:47.173", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["simplesamlphp"], "productName": ["xml-security"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/security/advisories/GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r"], "commits": ["https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/commit/f509e3083dd7870cce5880c804b5122317287581"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 666807, "Shell": 4055}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5774640?v=4", "stargazers": 2, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
