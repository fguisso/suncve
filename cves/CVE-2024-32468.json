Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities existed in the `deno_doc` crate which lead to Self-XSS with deno doc --html. 1.) XSS in generated `search_index.js`, `deno_doc` outputs a JavaScript file for searching. However, the generated file used `innerHTML` on unsanitzed HTML input. 2.) XSS via property, method and enum names, `deno_doc` did not sanitize property names, method names and enum names. The first XSS most likely didn't have an impact since `deno doc --html` is expected to be used locally with own packages."], "published": "2024-11-25T19:15:09.510", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["denoland"], "productName": ["deno"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-qqwr-j9mm-fhw6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-qqwr-j9mm-fhw6", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["deno", "javascript", "rust", "typescript"], "langs": {"Rust": 8071329, "JavaScript": 4952677, "TypeScript": 3550593, "CSS": 5811, "C": 4608, "C++": 1416, "HTML": 427, "WebAssembly": 304, "Dockerfile": 273, "Python": 214, "Svelte": 133, "Astro": 97, "Nunjucks": 45}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42048915?v=4", "stargazers": 102488, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
