The issue is patched in versions 11.0.0-beta.1, 10.0.1, 9.3.0 or 8.5.1 As a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute. This will prevent them creating top-frame navigations and is good practice anyway."], "published": "2020-10-06T18:15:14.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["electron"], "productName": ["electron"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-2q4g-w47c-4674"], "commits": ["https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/18613925610ba319da7f497b6deed85ad712c59b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/electron/electron/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c-plus-plus", "chrome", "css", "electron", "html", "javascript", "nodejs", "v8", "works-with-codespaces"], "langs": {"C++": 3900683, "TypeScript": 2231326, "Objective-C++": 392824, "JavaScript": 145343, "Python": 131218, "Objective-C": 41773, "HTML": 12057, "Shell": 8704, "C": 2472, "CSS": 2369}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13409222?v=4", "stargazers": 116233, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
