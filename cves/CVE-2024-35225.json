Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4. As a workaround, server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension."], "published": "2024-06-11T22:15:09.520", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jupyterhub"], "productName": ["jupyter-server-proxy"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-fvcq-4x64-hqxr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/commit/7abc9dc5bbb0b4b440548a5375261b8b8192fc22", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/commit/ff78128087e73fb9d0909e1366f8bf051e8ea878"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["binder", "jupyter", "jupyter-notebook", "jupyterhub", "proxy"], "langs": {"Python": 109108, "TypeScript": 12359, "RobotFramework": 4992, "JavaScript": 1609, "HTML": 109}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17927519?v=4", "stargazers": 364, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
