Starting in version 23.6.0 and prior to version 23.6.2, the Sentry API incorrectly returns the `access-control-allow-credentials: true` HTTP header if the `Origin` request header ends with the `system.base-hostname` option of Sentry installation. This only affects installations that have `system.base-hostname` option explicitly set, as it is empty by default. Impact is limited since recent versions of major browsers have cross-site cookie blocking enabled by default. However, this flaw could allow other multi-step attacks. The patch has been released in Sentry 23.6.2."], "published": "2023-07-06T23:15:09.620", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["getsentry"], "productName": ["sentry"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-4xqm-4p72-87h6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/ee44c6be35e5e464bc40637580f39867898acd8b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["apm", "crash-reporting", "crash-reports", "csp-report", "devops", "django", "error-logging", "error-monitoring", "fair-source", "hacktoberfest", "monitor", "monitoring", "python", "sentry", "tag-production"], "langs": {"Python": 42962697, "TypeScript": 33493085, "HTML": 265688, "Less": 219675, "Lua": 74910, "JavaScript": 58592, "PEG.js": 20144, "Shell": 17257, "Makefile": 7073, "Dockerfile": 4296, "EJS": 1803, "Ruby": 708}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1396951?v=4", "stargazers": 40494, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
