In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`), to store the session data in a database. Therefore, when a `session_id` is given, kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`).\nThus, a session which's lifetime is already `> time()`, is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function, that does remove invalid sessions, is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()`, based on `session.gc_divisor`, `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus, an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-12-19T00:15:06.713", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kanboard"], "productName": ["kanboard"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/security/advisories/GHSA-gv5c-8pxr-p484"], "commits": ["https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/7ce61c34d962ca8b5dce776289ddf4b207be6e78"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/security/advisories/GHSA-gv5c-8pxr-p484", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["agile", "kanban", "kanboard", "project-management", "self-hosted"], "langs": {"PHP": 8480827, "JavaScript": 128907, "CSS": 68161, "Dockerfile": 2671, "Makefile": 2660, "Shell": 1368}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13722943?v=4", "stargazers": 8758, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
