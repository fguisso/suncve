Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions. For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js. The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer."], "published": "2024-05-14T15:38:41.890", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["vercel"], "productName": ["next.js"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-77r5-gw3j-2mpf"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog", "browser", "compiler", "components", "hybrid", "nextjs", "node", "react", "server-rendering", "ssg", "static", "static-site-generator", "universal", "vercel"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 29894335, "TypeScript": 12883869, "Rust": 7130536, "CSS": 477383, "MDX": 279532, "Shell": 9978, "SCSS": 8077, "Dockerfile": 4523, "HTML": 2644, "Batchfile": 579, "WebAssembly": 497, "Sass": 302, "Pug": 49}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14985020?v=4", "stargazers": 130849, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Sudistark/rewrites-nextjs-CVE-2024-34350", "https://github.com/Sudistark/rewrites-nextjs-CVE-2024-34350"]}
