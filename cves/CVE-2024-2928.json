This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system, including sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to a previous patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's query string, highlighting the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI to prevent LFI attacks."], "published": "2024-06-06T19:15:55.680", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mlflow"], "productName": ["mlflow/mlflow"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/96f0b573a73d8eedd6735a2ce26e08859527be07"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "apache-spark", "machine-learning", "ml", "mlflow", "model-management"], "langs": {"Python": 13420900, "TypeScript": 4295123, "JavaScript": 2810964, "Java": 290984, "R": 211831, "Scala": 42315, "Shell": 38946, "HTML": 31852, "CSS": 22828, "Dockerfile": 1312, "Mako": 1004, "TSQL": 211}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39938107?v=4", "stargazers": 20047, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/nuridincersaygili/CVE-2024-2928", "https://github.com/nuridincersaygili/CVE-2024-2928"]}
