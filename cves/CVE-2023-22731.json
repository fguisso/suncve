In a Twig environment **without the Sandbox extension**, it is possible to refer to PHP functions in twig filters like `map`, `filter`, `sort`. This allows a template to call any global PHP function and thus execute arbitrary code. The attacker must have access to a Twig environment in order to exploit this vulnerability. This problem has been fixed with 6.4.18.1 with an override of the specified filters until the integration of the Sandbox extension has been finished. Users are advised to upgrade. Users of major versions 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 may also receive this fix via a plugin."], "published": "2023-01-17T22:15:10.977", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["shopware"], "productName": ["platform"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/shopware/platform/security/advisories/GHSA-93cw-f5jj-x85w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/shopware/platform/commit/89d1ea154689cb6202e0d3a0ceeae0febb0c09e1"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/shopware/platform/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api-first-cms", "apifirst", "digital-commerce", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-platform", "experience-commerce", "experience-manager", "hacktoberfest", "headless-cms", "magento", "online-shop", "online-store", "php", "prestashop", "shop", "shopping-cart", "shopware", "storefront", "symfony", "vuejs"], "langs": {"PHP": 33148885, "JavaScript": 12681381, "Twig": 4772824, "TypeScript": 2041509, "SCSS": 1023689, "CSS": 135217, "Vue": 32138, "Shell": 30355, "HTML": 27250, "Nix": 4870, "Groovy": 3900, "Smarty": 1174}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/612628?v=4", "stargazers": 2998, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
