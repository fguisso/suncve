This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of the source of a received LLDP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on an SFP interface to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable switching on the SFP interface, which could disrupt network traffic."], "published": "2021-02-24T20:15:13.193", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS System Software in ACI Mode "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
