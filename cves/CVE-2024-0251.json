This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This only affects sites when the Dynamic Content for Elementor plugin is also installed."], "published": "2024-01-13T08:15:06.720", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mihail-barinov"], "productName": ["Advanced Woo Search"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
