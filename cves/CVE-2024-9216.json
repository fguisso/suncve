The vulnerability arises because the username is provided via an HTTP request from the client side, rather than being read from a secure source like a cookie. This allows an attacker to pass another user's username to the get_model function, thereby gaining unauthorized access to that user's chat history."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:47.477", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gaizhenbiao"], "productName": ["gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
