This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note that this is only exploitable when the 'Leave a Review' notice is present, which occurs after 100 orders are made and disappears after a user dismisses the notice."], "published": "2024-10-16T02:15:06.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flycart"], "productName": ["Discount Rules for WooCommerce – Create Smart WooCommerce Coupons & Discounts, Bulk Discount, BOGO Coupons"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
