Prior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related to memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the `evm` crate can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it possible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack. The flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`. Users should upgrade to `==0.21.1, ==0.23.1, ==0.24.1, ==0.25.1, >=0.26.1`. There are no workarounds. Please upgrade your `evm` crate version."], "published": "2021-05-12T18:15:08.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rust-blockchain"], "productName": ["evm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/security/advisories/GHSA-4jwq-572w-4388"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/commit/19ade858c430ab13eb562764a870ac9f8506f8dd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 286068, "Solidity": 556}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56204398?v=4", "stargazers": 1241, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
