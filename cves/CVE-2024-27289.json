Prior to version 4.18.2, SQL injection can occur when all of the following conditions are met: the non-default simple protocol is used; a placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus; there must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder; both must be on the same line; and both parameter values must be user-controlled. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2. As a workaround, do not use the simple protocol or do not place a minus directly before a placeholder.\n"], "published": "2024-03-06T19:15:08.140", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jackc"], "productName": ["pgx"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jackc/pgx/security/advisories/GHSA-m7wr-2xf7-cm9p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jackc/pgx/commit/f94eb0e2f96782042c96801b5ac448f44f0a81df"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jackc/pgx/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 1736965, "HTML": 22905, "Shell": 4010, "Ruby": 463}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94130?v=4", "stargazers": 11584, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
