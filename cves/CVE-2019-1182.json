This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the target systems Remote Desktop Service via RDP.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Remote Desktop Services handles connection requests.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:16.813", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1703", "Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows Server, version 1803  (Server Core Installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1709", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1507", "Windows 10 Version 1607", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 8.1", "Windows Server 2012", "Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012 R2", "Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core installation)", "Microsoft Remote Desktop for Android", "Microsoft Remote Desktop for IoS", "Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
