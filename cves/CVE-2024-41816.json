The Cooked plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the ‘[cooked-timer]’ shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses a compromised page. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.8.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-08-05T20:15:35.630", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["XjSv"], "productName": ["Cooked"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/XjSv/Cooked/security/advisories/GHSA-3gw3-2qjq-xqjj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/XjSv/Cooked/commit/ac7455bdccc99fb2f5b3c7611312947c1623c3ec"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/XjSv/Cooked/security/advisories/GHSA-3gw3-2qjq-xqjj", "kw": ["poc", "steps to reproduce", "payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/XjSv/Cooked/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["wordpress", "wordpress-plugin"], "langs": {"PHP": 474738, "JavaScript": 430148, "CSS": 120384}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107681?v=4", "stargazers": 5, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
