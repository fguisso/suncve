Versions prior to 2.4.3, are subject to Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker can make a Meteor call to `validateAuthToken` using a victim's userId, meetingId, and an invalid authToken. This forces the victim to leave the conference, because the resulting verification failure is also observed and handled by the victim's client. The attacker must be a participant in any meeting on the server. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. There are no workarounds."], "published": "2022-12-16T00:15:13.530", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["bigbluebutton"], "productName": ["bigbluebutton"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-rgjp-3r74-g4cm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bigbluebutton", "collaboration", "conferencing", "video", "video-conferencing", "webrtc"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3902931, "Scala": 1671976, "TypeScript": 1667729, "Java": 1179516, "Ruby": 404534, "Shell": 280964, "Groovy": 164446, "CSS": 162616, "Go": 114808, "PLpgSQL": 99643, "Python": 75857, "HTML": 27674, "Batchfile": 2375, "Gherkin": 925, "Dockerfile": 59, "PostScript": 36}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230228?v=4", "stargazers": 8752, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
