A user's CSRF token was unnecessarily included in the URL when being redirected to a course they have just restored. A remote attacker can trick the victim to visit a specially crafted web page and perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim on the vulnerable website. This flaw allows an attacker to perform cross-site request forgery attacks."], "published": "2022-11-23T15:15:10.803", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Moodle"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
