In Node.js environments, the `Buffer` class extends the `Uint8Array` class. Node.js prevents path traversal through strings (see CVE-2023-30584) and `Buffer` objects (see CVE-2023-32004), but not through non-`Buffer` `Uint8Array` objects.\r\n\r\nThis is distinct from CVE-2023-32004 which only referred to `Buffer` objects. However, the vulnerability follows the same pattern using `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`.\r\n\r\nPlease note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js."], "published": "2023-10-18T04:15:11.330", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Node.js"], "productName": ["Node.js"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
