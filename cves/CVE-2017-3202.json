The ability to exploit this vulnerability depends on the availability of classes in the class path that make use of deserialization. A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control information may be able to send serialized Java objects with pre-set properties that result in arbitrary code execution when deserialized."], "published": "2018-06-11T17:29:00.617", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Exadel"], "productName": ["Flamingo amf-serializer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
