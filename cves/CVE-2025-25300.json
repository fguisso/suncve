Prior to version 1.14.1, clicking on smartbanner `View` link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It may allow hostile third parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original page with smartbanner. `rel=\"noopener\"` is automatically populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability. Some workarounds are available for those who cannot upgrade. Ensure `View` link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store security teams. If `View` link is going to a third party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel=\"noopener\"` is imposed on all `target=\"_blank\"` links. Version 1.14.1 of smartbanner.js contains a fix for the issue."], "published": "2025-02-18T18:15:35.330", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ain"], "productName": ["smartbanner.js"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/commit/fce8c31dfe04033d9d005a89694d3e7a60784f89"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android", "bower", "ecmascript6", "ios", "javascript", "mobile", "nodejs", "npm", "smart-app-banner", "smartbanner", "vanilla-js", "webdev"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 97173, "SCSS": 3374}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/370576?v=4", "stargazers": 626, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
