SOFARPC defaults to using the SOFA Hessian protocol to deserialize received data, while the SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But, prior to version 5.12.0, there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. Version 5.12.0 fixed this issue by adding a blacklist. SOFARPC also provides a way to add additional blacklists. Users can add a class like `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=org.apache.xpath.` to avoid this issue."], "published": "2024-01-23T18:15:19.433", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sofastack"], "productName": ["sofa-rpc"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/security/advisories/GHSA-7q8p-9953-pxvr"], "commits": ["https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/commit/42d19b1b1d14a25aafd9ef7c219c04a19f90fc76"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hessian", "http2", "protobuf", "restful", "rpc-framework", "sofa-bolt", "sofa-rpc", "sofastack"], "langs": {"Java": 5392238, "Mustache": 27767, "Shell": 4062}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36956638?v=4", "stargazers": 3863, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
