In affected versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` the `url.full` writes attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming http requests. These attributes are defined by the Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans. Up until version `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information, credentials, etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents. Note: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability. The `1.8.1` versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will now redact by default all values detected on transmitted or received query strings. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-04-12T23:15:06.643", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["open-telemetry"], "productName": ["opentelemetry-dotnet"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-vh2m-22xx-q94f"], "commits": ["https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/commit/e222ecb5942d4ce1cadfd4306c39e3f4933a5c42"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asp-net", "asp-net-core", "distributed-tracing", "ilogger", "iloggerprovider", "instrumentation-libraries", "logging", "metrics", "netcore", "opentelemetry", "otlp", "telemetry"], "langs": {"C#": 3058317, "PowerShell": 43377, "Python": 4416, "Shell": 3110, "Dockerfile": 2325, "Batchfile": 490}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49998002?v=4", "stargazers": 3426, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
