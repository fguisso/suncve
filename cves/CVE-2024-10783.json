This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as an administrator on instances where MainWP Child is not yet connected to the MainWP Dashboard. IMPORTANT: this only affects sites who have MainWP Child installed and have not yet connected to the MainWP Dashboard, and do not have the unique security ID feature enabled. Sites already connected to the MainWP Dashboard plugin and do not have the unique security ID feature enabled, are NOT affected and not required to upgrade. Please note 5.2.1 contains a partial patch, though we consider 5.3 to be the complete patch."], "published": "2024-12-13T10:15:06.400", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mainwp"], "productName": ["MainWP Child – Securely Connects to the MainWP Dashboard to Manage Multiple Sites"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
