This issue has been fixed from version 3.1.2 onwards. For users who use version 3.0.0 to 3.1.1, you can turn off the python-gateway function by changing the value `python-gateway.enabled=false` in configuration file `application.yaml`. If you are using the python gateway, please upgrade to version 3.1.2 or above.\n"], "published": "2023-04-20T16:15:07.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache DolphinScheduler"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
