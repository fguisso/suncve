The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of TCP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific sequence of packets at a high rate through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to temporarily disrupt traffic through the device while it reboots."], "published": "2019-05-03T15:29:01.040", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software ", "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
