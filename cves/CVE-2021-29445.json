In versions prior to 3.11.4 the AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithm (A128CBC-HS256, A192CBC-HS384, A256CBC-HS512) decryption would always execute both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption, if either failed `JWEDecryptionFailed` would be thrown. But a possibly observable difference in timing when padding error would occur while decrypting the ciphertext makes a padding oracle and an adversary might be able to make use of that oracle to decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average 128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block). A patch was released which ensures the HMAC tag is verified before performing CBC decryption. The fixed versions are `>=3.11.4`. Users should upgrade to `^3.11.4`."], "published": "2021-04-16T22:15:14.060", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["panva"], "productName": ["jose-node-esm-runtime"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/panva/jose/security/advisories/GHSA-4v4g-726h-xvfv"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/panva/jose/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["browser", "bun", "cloudflare-workers", "deno", "jose", "jsonwebtoken", "jwa", "jwe", "jwk", "jwks", "jws", "jwt", "node"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 432879, "JavaScript": 66055, "Shell": 3254}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/241506?v=4", "stargazers": 6295, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
