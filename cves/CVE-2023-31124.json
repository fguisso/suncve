When cross-compiling c-ares and using the autotools build system, CARES_RANDOM_FILE will not be set, as seen when cross compiling aarch64 android.  This will downgrade to using rand() as a fallback which could allow an attacker to take advantage of the lack of entropy by not using a CSPRNG. This issue was patched in version 1.19.1.\n"], "published": "2023-05-25T22:15:09.680", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["c-ares"], "productName": ["c-ares"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-54xr-f67r-4pc4"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["async", "c", "dns", "dns-queries", "library", "resolver"], "langs": {"C": 1443641, "M4": 132084, "CMake": 79870, "Makefile": 9553, "Shell": 5433, "Batchfile": 646}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16745161?v=4", "stargazers": 1936, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
