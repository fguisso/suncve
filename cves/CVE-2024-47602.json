A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. This function does not properly check the validity of the stream->codec_priv pointer in the following code. If stream->codec_priv is NULL, the call to GST_READ_UINT16_LE will attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash of the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:31.893", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
