This is due to the pms_pb_payment_redirect_link function using the user-controlled value supplied via the 'pms_payment_id' parameter to authenticate users without any further identity validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid payment ID to log in as any user who has made a purchase on the targeted site."], "published": "2025-01-14T10:15:07.250", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["madalinungureanu"], "productName": ["Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
