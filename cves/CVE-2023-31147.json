When /dev/urandom or RtlGenRandom() are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random numbers used for DNS query ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also not seeded by srand() so will generate predictable output. Input from the random number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4 implementation and may not be as strong as the original RC4 implementation. No attempt is made to look for modern OS-provided CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widely available. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1."], "published": "2023-05-25T22:15:09.833", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["c-ares"], "productName": ["c-ares"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-8r8p-23f3-64c2"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["async", "c", "dns", "dns-queries", "library", "resolver"], "langs": {"C": 1443641, "M4": 132084, "CMake": 79870, "Makefile": 9553, "Shell": 5433, "Batchfile": 646}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16745161?v=4", "stargazers": 1936, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
