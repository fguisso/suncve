The issue arises from improper input validation when handling HTTP POST requests to the endpoint `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`. Specifically, the application fails to validate or check user input before passing it to the `workspace_thread` Prisma model for execution. This oversight allows attackers to craft a Prisma relation query operation that manipulates the `users` model to change a user's role to admin. Successful exploitation grants attackers the highest level of user privileges, enabling them to see and perform all actions within the system."], "published": "2024-06-06T19:16:00.350", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mintplex-labs"], "productName": ["mintplex-labs/anything-llm"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/200bd7f0615347ed2efc07903d510e5a208b0afc"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["agent-framework-javascript", "ai-agents", "crewai", "custom-ai-agents", "deepseek", "deepseek-r1", "llama3", "llm", "lmstudio", "local-llm", "localai", "mcp", "mcp-servers", "multimodal", "ollama", "rag", "vector-database", "webui"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3589398, "CSS": 74448, "Dockerfile": 9300, "HTML": 3904, "Shell": 1382, "HCL": 1211}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134426827?v=4", "stargazers": 42340, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
