If the application uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the application trusts."], "published": "2025-03-11T18:15:34.730", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Adobe"], "productName": ["Illustrator"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
