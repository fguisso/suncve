In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-02-13T19:15:11.153", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OpenIDC"], "productName": ["mod_auth_openidc"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-hxr6-w4gc-7vvv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-hxr6-w4gc-7vvv", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["apache-httpd", "authentication", "c", "identity", "oidc", "openid-connect", "openidc", "openidconnect-client", "sso"], "langs": {"C": 1232169, "M4": 5579, "Makefile": 3475, "Shell": 62}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26088328?v=4", "stargazers": 1024, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
