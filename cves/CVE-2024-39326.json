Prior to version 2.12.6, the endpoint \n`/admin/projects/{projectname}/skills/{skillname}/video` (and probably others) is open to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Due to the endpoint being CSRFable e.g POST request, supports a content type that can be exploited (multipart file upload), makes a state change and has no CSRF mitigations in place (samesite flag, CSRF token). It is possible to perform a CSRF attack against a logged in admin account, allowing an attacker that can target a logged in admin of Skills Service to modify the videos, captions, and text of the skill. Version 2.12.6 contains a patch for this issue.\n"], "published": "2024-07-02T21:15:11.657", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["NationalSecurityAgency"], "productName": ["skills-service"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/security/advisories/GHSA-9624-qwxr-jr4j"], "commits": ["https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/commit/68d4235ddcb16e4f33fc7f19d14ff917817a366c"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/security/advisories/GHSA-9624-qwxr-jr4j", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Groovy": 9207931, "JavaScript": 4627022, "Vue": 2039695, "Java": 82409, "HTML": 20476, "Shell": 11296, "Dockerfile": 2716, "CSS": 2447, "SCSS": 927}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11298292?v=4", "stargazers": 457, "language": "Groovy"}}, "pocList": []}
