The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating incomplete traffic streams. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny access to the TVS for an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition, until an administrator restarts the service. Known Affected Releases 10.0(1.10000.24) 10.5(2.10000.5) 11.0(1.10000.10) 9.1(2.10000.28).
