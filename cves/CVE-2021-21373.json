In Nim release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS by default. In case of error it falls back to a non-TLS URL http://irclogs.nim-lang.org/packages.json. An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution."], "published": "2021-03-26T22:15:12.773", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nim-lang"], "productName": ["security"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nim-lang/security/security/advisories/GHSA-8w52-r35x-rgp8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nim-lang/security/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/603863?v=4", "stargazers": 5, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
