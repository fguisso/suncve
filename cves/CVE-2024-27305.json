SMTP smuggling is a novel vulnerability based on not so novel interpretation differences of the SMTP protocol. By exploiting SMTP smuggling, an attacker may send smuggle/spoof e-mails with fake sender addresses, allowing advanced phishing attacks. This issue is also existed in other SMTP software like Postfix. With the right SMTP server constellation, an attacker can send spoofed e-mails to inbound/receiving aiosmtpd instances. This issue has been addressed in version 1.4.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-03-12T21:15:58.630", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aio-libs"], "productName": ["aiosmtpd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiosmtpd/security/advisories/GHSA-pr2m-px7j-xg65"], "commits": ["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiosmtpd/commit/24b6c79c8921cf1800e27ca144f4f37023982bbb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiosmtpd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["asyncio", "email", "lmtp", "mail-mta", "mta", "python", "smtp", "smtp-mta", "smtp-server", "smtpd"], "langs": {"Python": 387282, "Makefile": 6770}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7049303?v=4", "stargazers": 335, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
