The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation in the NX-API feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP or HTTPS request to an internal service on an affected device that has the NX-API feature enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code as root. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.
