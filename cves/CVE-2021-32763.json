In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually."], "published": "2021-07-20T17:15:07.813", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["opf"], "productName": ["openproject"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-qqvp-j6gm-q56f"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["angular", "bcf", "boards", "bug-tracker", "gantt", "gantt-chart", "ifc", "issue-tracker", "kanban", "openproject", "project-management", "project-planning", "roadmap", "ruby", "scrum", "timeline", "workflows"], "langs": {"Ruby": 27773153, "TypeScript": 4615741, "HTML": 2723705, "Sass": 675223, "JavaScript": 115874, "Nix": 99153, "Shell": 91515, "SCSS": 14989, "API Blueprint": 13533, "CSS": 10185, "Perl": 9453, "Dockerfile": 8657, "Procfile": 132}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756674?v=4", "stargazers": 10287, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
