Versions of `solidus_frontend` prior to 3.1.5, 3.0.5, and 2.11.14 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows a malicious site to add an item to the user's cart without their knowledge. Versions 3.1.5, 3.0.5, and 2.11.14 contain a patch for this issue. The patch adds CSRF token verification to the \"Add to cart\" action. Adding forgery protection to a form that missed it can have some side effects. Other CSRF protection strategies as well as a workaround involving modifcation to config/application.rb` are available. More details on these mitigations are available in the GitHub Security Advisory."], "published": "2021-12-20T22:15:07.947", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["solidusio"], "productName": ["solidus"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/security/advisories/GHSA-h3fg-h5v3-vf8m"], "commits": ["https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/4d17cacf066d9492fc04eb3a0b16084b47376d81", "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/a1b9bf7f24f9b8684fc4d943eacb02b1926c77c6"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/security/advisories/GHSA-h3fg-h5v3-vf8m", "kw": ["steps:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ecommerce", "ecommerce-framework", "ecommerce-platform", "hacktoberfest", "rails", "ruby", "solidus", "storefront"], "langs": {"Ruby": 4018608, "HTML": 604253, "JavaScript": 149105, "SCSS": 75185, "Handlebars": 11544, "Shell": 4701, "Dockerfile": 2093, "CSS": 1209}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11045486?v=4", "stargazers": 5125, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
