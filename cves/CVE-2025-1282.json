This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). The add_car() function may also make it possible to read arbitrary files."], "published": "2025-02-27T09:15:10.160", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ThemeMakers"], "productName": ["Car Dealer Automotive WordPress Theme – Responsive"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
