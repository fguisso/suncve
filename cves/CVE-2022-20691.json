An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart.\r\n Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability.  \r\n"], "published": "2022-12-12T09:15:12.543", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
