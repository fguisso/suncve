However, the array used to store these registers was incorrectly\nsized, leading to memory corruption when accessing all four registers.\n\nThis commit corrects the array size to accommodate all four interrupt\nmask registers, preventing memory corruption during suspend and resume\noperations."], "published": "2025-02-27T02:15:11.503", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
