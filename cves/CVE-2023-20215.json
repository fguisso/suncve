An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an affected device to connect to a malicious server and receiving crafted HTTP responses. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an explicit block rule and receive traffic that should have been rejected by the device."], "published": "2023-08-03T22:15:11.513", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Secure Web Appliance"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
