An attacker could take advantage of this by altering the ansible_facts, such as ansible_hosts, users and any other key data which would lead into privilege escalation or code injection."], "published": "2020-03-24T14:15:12.327", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Ansible"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
