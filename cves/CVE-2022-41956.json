A file disclosure vulnerability was discovered in Autolab's remote handin feature, whereby users are able to hand-in assignments using paths outside their submission directory. Users can then view the submission to view the file's contents. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.10.0. As a workaround, ensure that the field for the remote handin feature is empty (Edit Assessment > Advanced > Remote handin path), and that you are not running Autolab as `root` (or any user that has write access to `/`). Alternatively, disable the remote handin feature if it is unneeded by replacing the body of `local_submit` in `app/controllers/assessment/handin.rb` with `render(plain: \"Feature disabled\", status: :bad_request) && return`."], "published": "2023-01-14T01:15:13.230", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["autolab"], "productName": ["Autolab"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-g7x7-mgrv-f24x"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["autograding", "autolab", "cmu", "education", "feedback", "programming", "rails", "scoreboard", "students", "teaching"], "langs": {"Ruby": 992209, "HTML": 371478, "JavaScript": 287494, "Java": 261126, "SCSS": 113948, "CSS": 16907, "Shell": 10622, "Dockerfile": 1584, "CoffeeScript": 211, "Python": 34}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2337016?v=4", "stargazers": 785, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
