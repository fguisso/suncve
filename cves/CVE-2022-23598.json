When rendering validation error messages via the `formElementErrors()` view helper shipped with laminas-form, many messages will contain the submitted value. However, in laminas-form prior to version 3.1.1, the value was not being escaped for HTML contexts, which could potentially lead to a reflected cross-site scripting attack. Versions 3.1.1 and above contain a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. A workaround is available. One may manually place code at the top of a view script where one calls the `formElementErrors()` view helper. More information about this workaround is available on the GitHub Security Advisory."], "published": "2022-01-28T22:15:16.770", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["laminas"], "productName": ["laminas-form"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/laminas/laminas-form/security/advisories/GHSA-jq4p-mq33-w375"], "commits": ["https://github.com/laminas/laminas-form/commit/43005a3ec4c2292d4f825273768d9b884acbca37"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/laminas/laminas-form/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["form-generator", "form-validation", "forms"], "langs": {"PHP": 1234711, "HTML": 59}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47865178?v=4", "stargazers": 80, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
