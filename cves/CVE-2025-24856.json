The account linking logic allows a pre-hijacking attack, leading to Account Takeover. The attack can only be exploited if the following requirements are met: (1) an attacker can anticipate the e-mail address of the user, (2) an attacker can register a public frontend user account using that e-mail address before the user's first OIDC login, and (3) the IDP returns an email field containing the e-mail address of the user,"], "published": "2025-03-16T04:15:14.517", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/xperseguers/t3ext-oidc/commit/877e09f6faf4c87bbb41233112ec7e30d3c902b3"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/xperseguers/t3ext-oidc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 104432, "HTML": 3647}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/646805?v=4", "stargazers": 12, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
