Starting from version 3.1.0 of the service-api XML parsing was introduced. Unfortunately the XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file which imports external Document Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery. This will be resolved in the 5.4.0 release."], "published": "2021-06-23T18:15:09.203", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["reportportal"], "productName": ["reportportal"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/security/advisories/GHSA-24wf-7vf2-pv59"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["automated-testing", "automation", "reporting-engine", "testing-tools"], "langs": {"Makefile": 1308}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17636279?v=4", "stargazers": 1834, "language": "Makefile"}}, "pocList": []}
