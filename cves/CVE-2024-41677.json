A potential mutation XSS vulnerability exists in Qwik for versions up to but not including 1.6.0. Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the rules found in the `render-ssr.ts` file. It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). This has been resolved in qwik version 1.6.0 and @builder.io/qwik version 1.7.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2024-08-06T18:15:56.883", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["QwikDev"], "productName": ["qwik"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/security/advisories/GHSA-2rwj-7xq8-4gx4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/commit/7e742eb3a1001542d795776c0317d47df8b9d64e"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/security/advisories/GHSA-2rwj-7xq8-4gx4", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["framework", "hacktoberfest", "javascript", "web"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 3368511, "MDX": 1118552, "JavaScript": 842626, "Rust": 252997, "CSS": 134406, "HTML": 27276, "Nix": 2469, "Dockerfile": 1339, "Makefile": 1279, "Shell": 60}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138123704?v=4", "stargazers": 21253, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
