The Notifications function allows for arbitrary binary execution and can be modified by any user. The resulting binary execution will occur in the context of any user running NetWorx. If an attacker modifies the Notifications function to execute a malicious binary, the binary will be executed by every user running NetWorx on that system."], "published": "2023-01-26T21:18:05.987", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
