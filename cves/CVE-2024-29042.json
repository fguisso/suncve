Prior to version 3.0.0, an attacker controlling the second variable of the `translate` function is able to perform a cache poisoning attack. They can change the outcome of translation requests made by subsequent users. The `opt.id` parameter allows the overwriting of the cache key. If an attacker sets the `id` variable to the cache key that would be generated by another user, they can choose the response that user gets served. Version 3.0.0 fixes this issue."], "published": "2024-03-22T17:15:07.990", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["franciscop"], "productName": ["translate"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/franciscop/translate/security/advisories/GHSA-882j-4vj5-7vmj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/franciscop/translate/commit/7a2bf8b9f05f7c45c09683973ef4d8e995804aa4", "https://github.com/franciscop/translate/commit/cc1ba03078102f83e0503a96f1a081489bb865d3"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/franciscop/translate/security/advisories/GHSA-882j-4vj5-7vmj", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/franciscop/translate/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 29022, "TypeScript": 2182}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2801252?v=4", "stargazers": 298, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
