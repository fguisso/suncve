The vulnerability is due to improper validation of directory traversal character sequences within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to arbitrary files on the affected device, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information."], "published": "2018-10-05T14:29:01.170", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router Firmware "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
