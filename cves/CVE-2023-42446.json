Starting in version 1.0.14 and prior to version 1.0.34, use of `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` is susceptible to session hijacking as expired keys are not being invalidated correctly on startup. A session may expire when all `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` instances have been shut down for a period that is longer than a session's remaining TTL. Version 1.0.34 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, expired keys, including all expired sessions, can be manually invalidated."], "published": "2023-09-18T22:15:47.247", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pow-auth"], "productName": ["pow"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/security/advisories/GHSA-3cjh-p6pw-jhv9"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["authentication", "authorization", "elixir", "phoenix", "user-management"], "langs": {"Elixir": 665181, "HTML": 131}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55240849?v=4", "stargazers": 1631, "language": "Elixir"}}, "pocList": []}
