Versions of `underscore.deep` prior to version 0.5.3 are vulnerable to a prototype pollution vulnerability. An attacker can craft a malicious payload and pass it to `deepFromFlat`, which would pollute any future Objects created. Any users that have `deepFromFlat` or `deepPick` (due to its dependency on `deepFromFlat`) in their code should upgrade to version 0.5.3 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by modifying `deepFromFlat` to prevent specific keywords which will prevent this from happening."], "published": "2022-06-28T18:15:08.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Clever"], "productName": ["underscore.deep"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/security/advisories/GHSA-8j79-hfj5-f2xm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/commit/b5e109ad05b48371be225fa4d490dd08a94e8ef7"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"CoffeeScript": 18483, "Makefile": 872}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1885509?v=4", "stargazers": 27, "language": "CoffeeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
