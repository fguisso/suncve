Versions prior to 1.13.2 are potentially vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Initializing a checkboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes that parent label contents considered as the input label. Calling `.checkboxradio( \"refresh\" )` on such a widget and the initial HTML contained encoded HTML entities will make them erroneously get decoded. This can lead to potentially executing JavaScript code. The bug has been patched in jQuery UI 1.13.2. To remediate the issue, someone who can change the initial HTML can wrap all the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`."], "published": "2022-07-20T20:15:08.053", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["jquery"], "productName": ["jquery-ui"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-h6gj-6jjq-h8g9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/8cc5bae1caa1fcf96bf5862c5646c787020ba3f9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "jquery"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1478680, "HTML": 158797, "CSS": 41855}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70142?v=4", "stargazers": 11296, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
