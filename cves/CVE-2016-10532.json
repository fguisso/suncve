A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command that the user who is running the console-io application 2.2.13 and earlier is able to run. This means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the system. This vulnerability exists because the console-io application does not configure socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands and receive the response."], "published": "2018-05-31T20:29:01.067", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["HackerOne"], "productName": ["console-io node module"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
