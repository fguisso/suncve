For a multishot request, we can safely\nignore a spurious wakeup, as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.\n\nA blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a\nbuffer, if they are ring provided. While this seems like a bug in itself,\nit's not really defined behavior to reissue a multishot request directly.\nIt's less efficient to do so as well, and not required to rearm anything\nlike it is for singleshot poll requests."], "published": "2024-08-21T07:15:06.007", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
