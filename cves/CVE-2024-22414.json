Improper storage and rendering of the `/user/<user>` page allows a user's comments to execute arbitrary javascript code. The html template `user.html` contains the following code snippet to render comments made by a user: `<div class=\"content\" tag=\"content\">{{comment[2]|safe}}</div>`. Use of the \"safe\" tag causes flask to _not_ escape the rendered content. To remediate this, simply remove the `|safe` tag from the HTML above. No fix is is available and users are advised to manually edit their installation."], "published": "2024-01-17T21:15:12.100", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["DogukanUrker"], "productName": ["flaskBlog"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/DogukanUrker/flaskBlog/security/advisories/GHSA-mrcw-j96f-p6v6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/DogukanUrker/flaskBlog/security/advisories/GHSA-mrcw-j96f-p6v6", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/DogukanUrker/flaskBlog/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["blog", "collaborate", "flask", "jetbrains", "passlib", "python", "ruff", "sqlite", "tailwindcss", "uv", "wtforms"], "langs": {"Python": 337594, "Jinja": 115749, "JavaScript": 18557, "CSS": 3522, "Dockerfile": 1025}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62756402?v=4", "stargazers": 161, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
