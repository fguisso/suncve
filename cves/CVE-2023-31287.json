Password reset links are sent by email. A link contains a token that is used to reset the password. This token remains valid even after the password reset and can be used a second time to change the password of the corresponding user. The token expires only 3 hours after issuance and is sent as a query parameter when resetting. An attacker with access to the browser history can thus use the token again to change the password in order to take over the account."], "published": "2023-04-27T03:15:10.200", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity/commit/11b9d267f840513d04b4f4d4876de7823a6e48d2"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["application-platform", "aspnet", "aspnetcore", "c-sharp", "dotnet-core", "dotnet6", "rapid", "serenity", "serenity-platform", "typescript", "visual-studio"], "langs": {"C#": 5503024, "TypeScript": 2110286, "JavaScript": 808777, "CSS": 236321, "HTML": 76999, "Batchfile": 4472, "Dockerfile": 487}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72254722?v=4", "stargazers": 2635, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
