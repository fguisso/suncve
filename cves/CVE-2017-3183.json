By modifying the USER_CODE value to match that of a privileged user, a low-privileged, authenticated user may gain privileged access to the SQL database. A remote, authenticated user can submit specially crafted SQL queries to gain privileged access to the application database."], "published": "2018-07-24T15:29:00.500", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Sage"], "productName": ["XRT Treasury"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
