A vulnerability was discovered in SABnzbd that could trick the `filesystem.renamer()` function into writing downloaded files outside the configured Download Folder via malicious PAR2 files. A patch was released as part of SABnzbd 3.2.1RC1. As a workaround, limit downloads to NZBs without PAR2 files, deny write permissions to the SABnzbd process outside areas it must access to perform its job, or update to a fixed version."], "published": "2021-05-07T15:15:07.503", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sabnzbd"], "productName": ["sabnzbd"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/security/advisories/GHSA-jwj3-wrvf-v3rp"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["binary-newsreader", "python", "usenet"], "langs": {"Python": 1959383, "JavaScript": 229219, "CSS": 85784, "NSIS": 30943, "HTML": 11096, "Shell": 1323, "Batchfile": 545, "SRecode Template": 2}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/960698?v=4", "stargazers": 2447, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
