ZITADEL's user account deactivation mechanism did not work correctly with service accounts. Deactivated service accounts retained the ability to request tokens, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10 have been released which address this issue. Users are advised t upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may instead of deactivating the service account, consider creating new credentials and replacing the old ones wherever they are used. This effectively prevents the deactivated service account from being utilized. Be sure to revoke all existing authentication keys associated with the service account and to rotate the service account's password."], "published": "2024-09-20T00:15:03.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["zitadel"], "productName": ["zitadel"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-qr2h-7pwm-h393"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["2fa", "authentication", "authorization", "fido2", "identity", "login", "mfa", "multitenancy", "oauth2", "oidc", "openid-connect", "passkeys", "saml", "scim", "sso", "user"], "langs": {"Go": 15519270, "TypeScript": 1964716, "HTML": 776775, "SCSS": 354988, "CSS": 112445, "JavaScript": 30160, "PLpgSQL": 14823, "Makefile": 10576, "Dockerfile": 9073, "Shell": 238}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70011121?v=4", "stargazers": 10209, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
