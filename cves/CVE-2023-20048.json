This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of configuration commands that are sent through the web service interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the FMC web services interface and sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute certain configuration commands on the targeted FTD device. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials on the FMC Software."], "published": "2023-11-01T18:15:08.907", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Firepower Management Center"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/0zer0d4y/FuegoTest", "https://github.com/0zer0d4y/FuegoTest"]}
