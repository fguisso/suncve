The Swift object store and proxy server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved from the Swauth middleware authentication mechanism to a log file as part of a GET URI. This allows attackers to bypass authentication by inserting a token into an X-Auth-Token header of a new request. NOTE: github.com/openstack/swauth URLs do not mean that Swauth is maintained by an official OpenStack project team."], "published": "2017-11-21T13:29:00.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/openstack/swauth/commit/70af7986265a3defea054c46efc82d0698917298"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/openstack/swauth/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63051644?v=4", "stargazers": 26, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
