It was discovered that due to improper handling and escaping of user-provided query parameters, a maliciously crafted Nautobot URL could potentially be used to execute a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS) attack against users. All filterable object-list views in Nautobot are vulnerable. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.20 and 2.2.3. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"], "published": "2024-05-01T11:15:47.407", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["nautobot"], "productName": ["nautobot"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-jxgr-gcj5-cqqg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/42440ebd9b381534ad89d62420ebea00d703d64e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dcim", "hacktoberfest", "ipam", "nautobot", "network-automation", "python", "sot"], "langs": {"Python": 8362008, "HTML": 1060828, "JavaScript": 108818, "CSS": 45532, "Jinja": 28376, "Gherkin": 14390, "Dockerfile": 11222, "Shell": 8955}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75628359?v=4", "stargazers": 1167, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
