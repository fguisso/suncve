Prior to versions `0.3.3+8.13.9` and `0.2.5+8.11.3`, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string. In a typical deployment of `rust-phonenumber`, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber over the network, specifically the string `.;phone-context=`. Versions `0.3.3+8.13.9` and `0.2.5+8.11.3` contain a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2023-09-19T15:15:56.660", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["whisperfish"], "productName": ["rust-phonenumber"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/security/advisories/GHSA-whhr-7f2w-qqj2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/2dd44be94539c051b4dee55d1d9d349bd7bedde6", "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/bea8e732b9cada617ede5cf51663dba183747f71"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["formatter", "parser", "phone-number", "rust", "rust-library", "validator"], "langs": {"Rust": 159572, "Shell": 502}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82575565?v=4", "stargazers": 170, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
