This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This was partially patched in version 2.2.7 and fully patched in version 2.2.9."], "published": "2023-11-22T16:15:13.657", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ggnomes"], "productName": ["Garden Gnome Package"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
