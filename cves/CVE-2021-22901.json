A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in memory."], "published": "2021-06-11T16:15:11.120", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["https://github.com/curl/curl"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7f4a9a9b2a49547eae24d2e19bc5c346e9026479"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/curl/curl/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "client", "curl", "ftp", "gopher", "hacktoberfest", "http", "https", "imaps", "ldap", "libcurl", "library", "mqtt", "pop3", "scp", "sftp", "transfer-data", "transferring-data", "user-agent", "websocket"], "langs": {"C": 7980094, "Perl": 862039, "M4": 511636, "Python": 467183, "CMake": 290967, "DIGITAL Command Language": 237294, "Shell": 139333, "Makefile": 122565, "Batchfile": 43953, "Dockerfile": 1711, "Raku": 1598, "Emacs Lisp": 1348}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16928085?v=4", "stargazers": 37377, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
