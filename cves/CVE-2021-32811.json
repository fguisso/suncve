Zope versions prior to versions 4.6.3 and 5.3 have a remote code execution security issue. In order to be affected, one must use Python 3 for one's Zope deployment, run Zope 4 below version 4.6.3 or Zope 5 below version 5.3, and have the optional `Products.PythonScripts` add-on package installed. By default, one must have the admin-level Zope \"Manager\" role to add or edit Script (Python) objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web are at risk. Zope releases 4.6.3 and 5.3 are not vulnerable. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing Script (Python) objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope."], "published": "2021-08-02T22:15:08.333", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["zopefoundation"], "productName": ["Zope"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-g4gq-j4p2-j8fr", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/f72a18dda8e9bf2aedb46168761668464a4be988"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["application-server", "maintained", "python", "python-3-only", "web", "wsgi"], "langs": {"Python": 2102252, "CSS": 148167, "HTML": 29796, "JavaScript": 11022}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1163184?v=4", "stargazers": 360, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
