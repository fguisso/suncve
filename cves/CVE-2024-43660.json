The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The confidentiality of all files of the devicd can be compromised (VC:H/VI:N/VA:N).  There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). While this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, this attack in isolation does not have a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y)."], "published": "2025-01-09T08:15:29.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Iocharger"], "productName": ["Iocharger firmware for AC models"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
