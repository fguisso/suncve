This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device using root-level privileges. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, only commands without parameters can be executed."], "published": "2021-08-04T18:15:08.787", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
