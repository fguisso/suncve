This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation checks while processing boot options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying device boot options to execute attacker-provided code. A successful exploit may allow an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot process and execute malicious code on an affected device with root-level privileges."], "published": "2020-06-03T18:15:18.747", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XE Software 16.9.2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
