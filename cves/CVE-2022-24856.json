FlyteConsole prior to version 0.52.0 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) when FlyteConsole is open to the general internet. An attacker can exploit any user of a vulnerable instance to access the internal metadata server or other unauthenticated URLs. Passing of headers to an unauthorized actor may occur. The patch for this issue deletes the entire `cors_proxy`, as this is not required for console anymore. A patch is available in FlyteConsole version 0.52.0. Disable FlyteConsole availability on the internet as a workaround."], "published": "2022-05-17T16:15:09.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flyteorg"], "productName": ["flyteconsole"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/security/advisories/GHSA-www6-hf2v-v9m9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/commit/05b88ed2d2ecdb5d8a8404efea25414e57189709"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["flyte", "graph", "hacktoberfest", "machine-learning", "mlops", "protocol-buffers", "react", "redux", "typescript", "ui"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 2193205, "JavaScript": 34243, "Shell": 8470, "MDX": 5440, "CSS": 2254, "Makefile": 1652, "HTML": 1562, "Dockerfile": 981}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35380635?v=4", "stargazers": 37, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
