This is possible through the use of LLMNR, MBT-NS, or MDNS and will result in NTLMv2 hashes being sent to a malicious entity position on the local network. These hashes can subsequently be attacked through brute force and cracked if a weak password is used. This attack would only apply to domain joined systems."], "published": "2023-11-28T21:15:07.440", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD)"], "productName": ["FACSChorus"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
