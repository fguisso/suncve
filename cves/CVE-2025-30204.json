Prior to \n5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer  followed by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2."], "published": "2025-03-21T22:15:26.420", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["golang-jwt"], "productName": ["jwt"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-mh63-6h87-95cp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/0951d184286dece21f73c85673fd308786ffe9c3"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["auth", "ed25519", "go", "golang", "jwt", "security"], "langs": {"Go": 186063}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84194169?v=4", "stargazers": 7876, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
