The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to a TarSlip vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victim's system via path traversal or faked symlinks."], "published": "2025-03-20T10:15:27.450", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dmlc"], "productName": ["dmlc/gluon-cv"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
