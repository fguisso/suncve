A vulnerability present in versions 0.10.0 through 1.0.2 allows to set up a template that allows to embed arbitrary Javascript. This enables the attacker to act on behalf of the user, if the template is being previewed; and act on behalf of the headless browser, if a report using the template is printed to PDF. This issue has been resolved in version 1.0.3 of Icinga Reporting. As a workaround, review all templates and remove suspicious settings."], "published": "2025-03-26T16:15:23.147", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Icinga"], "productName": ["icingaweb2-module-reporting"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/security/advisories/GHSA-7qvq-54vm-r7hx"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["icingaweb2", "monitoring", "reporting", "reports", "sla"], "langs": {"PHP": 140416, "Less": 3651, "CSS": 1458, "PLpgSQL": 1380, "HTML": 404}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/835441?v=4", "stargazers": 67, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
