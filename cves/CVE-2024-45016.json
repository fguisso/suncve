When this happens qlen_notify() may be\nskipped on the parent during destruction, leaving a dangling pointer\nfor some classful qdiscs like DRR.\n\nThere are two ways for the bug happen:\n\n- If the duplicated packet is dropped by rootq->enqueue() and then\n  the original packet is also dropped.\n- If rootq->enqueue() sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc\n  and the original packet is dropped.\n\nIn both cases NET_XMIT_SUCCESS is returned even though no packets\nare enqueued at the netem qdisc.\n\nThe fix is to defer the enqueue of the duplicate packet until after\nthe original packet has been guaranteed to return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS."], "published": "2024-09-11T16:15:06.817", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
