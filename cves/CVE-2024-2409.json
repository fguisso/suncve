This is due to insufficient validation checks within the _register_user() function called by the 'wp_ajax_nopriv_stm_lms_register' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register a user with administrator-level privileges when MasterStudy LMS Pro is installed and the LMS Forms Editor add-on is enabled."], "published": "2024-03-29T09:15:07.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stylemix"], "productName": ["MasterStudy LMS WordPress Plugin â€“ for Online Courses and Education"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
