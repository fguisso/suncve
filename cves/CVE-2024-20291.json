An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access network resources that should be protected by an ACL that was applied on port channel subinterfaces."], "published": "2024-02-29T01:43:59.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco NX-OS Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/Instructor-Team8/CVE-2024-20291-POC", "https://github.com/Instructor-Team8/CVE-2024-20291-POC"]}
