Fix this by keeping the submission_state lock held\naround the check to postpone the free and make the check safe, before\ndropping again around the put() to avoid the deadlock.\n\n(cherry picked from commit d28af0b6b9580b9f90c265a7da0315b0ad20bbfd)"], "published": "2024-10-21T18:15:15.920", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
