Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0."], "published": "2020-01-22T19:15:11.140", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Pylons"], "productName": ["Waitress"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4ppp-gpcr-7qf6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/575994cd42e83fd772a5f7ec98b2c56751bd3f65"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["http-server", "python", "wsgi-server"], "langs": {"Python": 495249}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/452227?v=4", "stargazers": 1489, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
