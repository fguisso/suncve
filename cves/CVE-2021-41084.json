In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`Ã¥), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening."], "published": "2021-09-21T18:15:07.427", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["http4s"], "productName": ["http4s"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/http4s/http4s/security/advisories/GHSA-5vcm-3xc3-w7x3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/http4s/http4s/commit/d02007db1da4f8f3df2dbf11f1db9ac7afc3f9d8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/http4s/http4s/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cats", "fs2", "http", "http-client", "http-server", "scala", "typelevel"], "langs": {"Scala": 3083504, "Nix": 1141, "HTML": 19, "Shell": 10}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1527492?v=4", "stargazers": 2571, "language": "Scala"}}, "pocList": []}
