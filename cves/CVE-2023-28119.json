Prior to version 0.4.13, the package's use of `flate.NewReader` does not limit the size of the input. The user can pass more than 1 MB of data in the HTTP request to the processing functions, which will be decompressed server-side using the Deflate algorithm. Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple times, it is possible to achieve a reliable crash since the operating system kills the process. This issue is patched in version 0.4.13."], "published": "2023-03-22T20:15:12.877", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["crewjam"], "productName": ["saml"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/crewjam/saml/security/advisories/GHSA-5mqj-xc49-246p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/crewjam/saml/commit/8e9236867d176ad6338c870a84e2039aef8a5021"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/crewjam/saml/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 448628}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5651547?v=4", "stargazers": 1005, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
