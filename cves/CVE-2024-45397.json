When an HTTP request using TLS/1.3 early data on top of TCP Fast Open or QUIC 0-RTT packets is received and the IP-address-based access control is used, the access control does not detect and prohibit HTTP requests conveyed by packets with a spoofed source address. This behavior allows attackers on the network to execute HTTP requests from addresses that are otherwise rejected by the address-based access control. The vulnerability has been addressed in commit 15ed15a. Users may disable the use of TCP FastOpen and QUIC to mitigate the issue."], "published": "2024-10-11T15:15:04.690", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["h2o"], "productName": ["h2o"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/h2o/h2o/security/advisories/GHSA-jf2c-xjcp-wg4c"], "commits": ["https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/15ed15a2efb83a77bb4baaa5a119e639c2f6898a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/h2o/h2o/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 3167917, "Perl": 852069, "Mathematica": 212238, "Ruby": 66838, "Shell": 61760, "CMake": 43218, "Python": 27144, "C++": 24060, "PHP": 10137, "Makefile": 9686, "DTrace": 7182, "HTML": 6430, "Vim Script": 73, "JavaScript": 16}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9275116?v=4", "stargazers": 11049, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
