This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to overwrite arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."], "published": "2024-09-24T03:15:03.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Ex-Themes"], "productName": ["WooEvents - Calendar and Event Booking"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
