The function is able to accept a hostname and return an IP address for that hostname. To get the IP address the function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with `helm install|upgrade|template` or when the Helm SDK is used to render a chart. Information passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server. The issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1. Prior to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName` function is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed to DNS servers."], "published": "2023-02-08T20:15:24.937", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["helm"], "productName": ["helm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8"], "commits": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/5abcf74227bfe8e5a3dbf105fe62e7b12deb58d2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/helm/helm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["chart", "charts", "cncf", "helm", "kubernetes"], "langs": {"Go": 2008774, "Shell": 30899, "Makefile": 8750}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15859888?v=4", "stargazers": 27695, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
