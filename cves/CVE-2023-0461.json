To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.\n\nThere is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock.\n\nWhen CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.\n\nThe setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c"], "published": "2023-02-28T15:15:11.550", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux Kernel"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/hshivhare67/kernel_v4.19.72_CVE-2023-0461", "https://github.com/hshivhare67/kernel_v4.19.72_CVE-2023-0461"]}
