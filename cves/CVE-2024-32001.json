Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder->view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for either `folder` or `folder#parent`. This bug only manifests if the same subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types and an arrow is used over the relation. Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected. Version 1.30.1 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema.\n"], "published": "2024-04-10T23:15:07.363", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["authzed"], "productName": ["spicedb"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-j85q-46hg-36p2"], "commits": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/a244ed1edfaf2382711dccdb699971ec97190c7b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["abac", "acl", "ciam", "cloud-native", "database", "distributed-systems", "entitlements", "fga", "fine-grained-access-control", "grpc", "kubernetes", "latency", "permissions", "production", "rbac", "rebac", "scale", "security", "security-tools", "zanzibar"], "langs": {"Go": 4944305, "JavaScript": 16612, "HTML": 3663, "Dockerfile": 1496}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73313589?v=4", "stargazers": 5527, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
