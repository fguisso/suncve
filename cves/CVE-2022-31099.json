When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-06-27T23:15:08.043", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rulex-rs"], "productName": ["rulex"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/security/advisories/GHSA-v78m-2q7v-fjqp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/commit/60aa2dc03a22d69c8800fec81f99c96958a11363"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["pomsky", "regex", "regexp", "regular-expression", "rust-lang"], "langs": {"Rust": 521533, "Shell": 5629, "JavaScript": 3059, "Just": 2589, "Java": 2397, "C#": 1914, "Python": 1103}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105723153?v=4", "stargazers": 1303, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
