An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the DHCP service to become nonresponsive.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted packet to a DHCP server. However, the DHCP server must be set to failover mode for the attack to succeed.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how DHCP failover servers handle network packets.\n"], "published": "2019-08-14T21:15:18.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows Server, version 1803  (Server Core Installation)", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2016", "Windows Server 2016 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012", "Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation)", "Windows Server 2012 R2", "Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core installation)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
