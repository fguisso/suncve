The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 9.0.4.\n"], "published": "2024-06-28T18:15:04.853", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["CycloneDX"], "productName": ["cyclonedx-core-java"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/security/advisories/GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/security/advisories/GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["bill-of-materials", "bom", "cyclonedx", "library", "mbom", "obom", "owasp", "package-url", "purl", "saasbom", "sbom", "software-bill-of-materials", "spdx", "vex"], "langs": {"Java": 855115, "Shell": 331}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29029855?v=4", "stargazers": 93, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
