The full path to the command is not enforced, which results in a search in the search path until a binary can be identified. This makes the installer/uninstaller vulnerable to Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker to plant a malicious reg.exe command so it takes precedence over the system command. The vulnerability only affects Windows installers."], "published": "2021-10-29T12:15:07.573", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["VMware InstallBuilder"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
