Versions prior to 1.4.19 may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. XStream 1.4.19 monitors and accumulates the time it takes to add elements to collections and throws an exception if a set threshold is exceeded. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may set the NO_REFERENCE mode to prevent recursion. See GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf for further details on a workaround if an upgrade is not possible."], "published": "2022-02-01T12:15:08.080", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["x-stream"], "productName": ["xstream"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/commit/e8e88621ba1c85ac3b8620337dd672e0c0c3a846"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf", "kw": ["steps to reproduce"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["java", "xml", "xstream"], "langs": {"Java": 2852082, "HTML": 711607, "CSS": 7028, "Batchfile": 2073, "Shell": 1714, "XSLT": 1128}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12127637?v=4", "stargazers": 752, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
