This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to interact with the plugin in ways administrators are intended to. One action (save_config) allows for the configuration of an external CDN. This could be used to include malicious javascript from a source controlled by the attacker."], "published": "2023-06-07T02:15:15.687", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FlyingWeb"], "productName": ["FlyingPress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
