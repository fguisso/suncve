Versions 0.2.3 and prior do not verify the returned data packets, and there is a deserialization vulnerability which may lead to remote code execution. When weblogic-framework gets the command echo, it directly deserializes the data returned by the server without verifying it. At the same time, the classloader loads a lot of deserialization calls. In this case, the malicious serialized data returned by the server will cause remote code execution. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.\n\n"], "published": "2023-08-25T21:15:08.880", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dream0x01"], "productName": ["weblogic-framework"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/dream0x01/weblogic-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-hjwj-4f3q-44h3"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/dream0x01/weblogic-framework/", "info": {"exist": false, "topics": null, "langs": {}, "avatar": null, "stargazers": 0, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
