A user on Appsmith that doesn't have admin permissions can trigger the restart API on Appsmith, causing a server restart. This is still within the Appsmith container, and the impact is limited to Appsmith's own server only, but there is a denial of service because it can be continually restarted. This is due to incorrect access control checks, which should check for super user permissions on the incoming request."], "published": "2025-03-26T20:15:21.253", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/security/advisories/GHSA-6mc8-hw5c-7qqr"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["admin-dashboard", "admin-panels", "app-builder", "automation", "crud", "custom-internal", "developer-tools", "gui", "gui-application", "hacktoberfest", "internal-tools", "java", "javascript", "low-code", "low-code-framework", "react", "self-hosted", "typescript", "webdevelopment", "workflows"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 24262188, "Java": 7790233, "JavaScript": 3522297, "CSS": 364722, "Shell": 193482, "HTML": 178857, "MDX": 90700, "Dockerfile": 6508, "Handlebars": 6339, "Smarty": 3803, "Python": 3209, "HCL": 2207, "Procfile": 84}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67620218?v=4", "stargazers": 36545, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
