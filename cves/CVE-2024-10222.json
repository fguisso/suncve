This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file. By default, this can only be exploited by administrators, but the ability to upload SVG files can be extended to authors."], "published": "2025-02-21T14:15:30.680", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["benbodhi"], "productName": ["SVG Support"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/benbodhi/svg-support/commit/eee3e13b650511c9cc9ee0746be485d031c7c072"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/benbodhi/svg-support/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"PHP": 92968, "JavaScript": 36002, "SCSS": 8341, "CSS": 97}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5193411?v=4", "stargazers": 2, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
