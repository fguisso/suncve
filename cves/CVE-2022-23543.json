Users can attach URLs to YouTube videos, the site will generate related `<iframe>` when the post will be published. The handler has some sort of protection so non-YouTube links can't be posted, as well as HTML tags are being stripped. However, it was still possible to add custom HTML attributes (e.g. `onclick=alert(\"xss\")`) to the `<iframe>'. This issue was fixed in the version `1.1.34` and does not require any extra actions from our members. There has been no evidence that this vulnerability was used by anyone at this time."], "published": "2022-12-19T22:15:10.920", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mesosoi"], "productName": ["silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mesosoi/silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker/security/advisories/GHSA-62r9-4v3r-rw89"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mesosoi/silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13075030?v=4", "stargazers": 4, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
