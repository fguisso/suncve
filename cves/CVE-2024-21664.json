Calling `jws.Parse` with a JSON serialized payload where the `signature` field is present while `protected` is absent can lead to a nil pointer dereference. The vulnerability can be used to crash/DOS a system doing JWS verification. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 2.0.19 and 1.2.28.\n"], "published": "2024-01-09T20:15:43.740", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["lestrrat-go"], "productName": ["jwx"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-pvcr-v8j8-j5q3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/0e8802ce6842625845d651456493e7c87625601f", "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/8c53d0ae52d5ab1e2b37c5abb67def9e7958fd65", "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/d69a721931a5c48b9850a42404f18e143704adcd"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-pvcr-v8j8-j5q3", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["go", "golang", "jwe", "jwk", "jws", "jwt", "oidc"], "langs": {"Go": 1001540, "Starlark": 24657, "Shell": 7002, "Perl": 2801, "Makefile": 2366}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36653903?v=4", "stargazers": 2045, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
