This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Only sites that have manually added tribe_has_next_event() will be vulnerable to this SQL injection."], "published": "2024-09-25T05:15:11.497", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["theeventscalendar"], "productName": ["The Events Calendar"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/p33d/CVE-2024-8275", "https://github.com/whiterose7777/CVE-2024-8275", "https://github.com/p33d/CVE-2024-8275", "https://github.com/whiterose7777/CVE-2024-8275"]}
