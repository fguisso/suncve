When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into mounting sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host system."], "published": "2024-10-01T19:15:09.500", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
