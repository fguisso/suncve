WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is evaluated first. \n\nUntil WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15, the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMockâ€™s instance. For example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations."], "published": "2023-09-06T21:15:14.323", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wiremock"], "productName": ["wiremock"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/security/advisories/GHSA-hq8w-9w8w-pmx7"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["apis", "hacktoberfest", "http", "java", "json", "mock-server", "mocking", "rest", "stubbing", "wiremock", "xml"], "langs": {"Java": 3767145, "XSLT": 14502, "HTML": 10783, "Scala": 6576, "JavaScript": 1882, "Shell": 1066, "CSS": 202}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21368587?v=4", "stargazers": 6696, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
