This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own."], "published": "2018-07-27T14:29:00.207", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["[UNKNOWN]"], "productName": ["undertow"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/tafamace/CVE-2017-2666", "https://github.com/tafamace/CVE-2017-2666"]}
