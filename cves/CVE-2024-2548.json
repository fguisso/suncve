Due to inadequate validation of file paths between Windows and Linux environments using `Path(path).is_absolute()`, attackers can exploit this flaw to read any file on the system. This issue affects the latest version of LoLLMs running on the Windows platform. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker sends a specially crafted request to the `/user_infos/{path:path}` endpoint, allowing the reading of arbitrary files, as demonstrated with the `win.ini` file. The issue has been addressed in version 9.5 of the software."], "published": "2024-06-06T19:15:55.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["parisneo"], "productName": ["parisneo/lollms-webui"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/49b0332e98d42dd5204dda53dee410b160106265"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ai", "llm", "text-generation"], "langs": {"CSS": 3034388, "Vue": 1267094, "Python": 366554, "JavaScript": 194610, "Shell": 41865, "Batchfile": 30713, "Inno Setup": 27460, "HTML": 24508, "Jupyter Notebook": 3623, "Dockerfile": 1060}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827993?v=4", "stargazers": 4600, "language": "CSS"}}, "pocList": []}
