Starting with version 1.14.0 and prior to version 1.27.0, Prism's command line plugin can be used by attackers to achieve a cross-site scripting attack. The command line plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text being inserted into the DOM as HTML code. Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the Command Line plugin are also not impacted. This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0. As a workaround, do not use the command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitize all code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use the command line plugin."], "published": "2022-02-18T15:15:07.740", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PrismJS"], "productName": ["prism"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99"], "commits": ["https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/commit/e002e78c343154e1c0ddf9d6a0bb85689e1a5c7c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1059890, "HTML": 235863, "CSS": 50253, "C": 543, "Lua": 422, "C++": 306, "Shell": 244, "Awk": 106}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11140484?v=4", "stargazers": 12532, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
