These rsp buffers have values in them, such as buffer lengths, that need to be validated to ensure that no buffer overflow/over-reads happen. However, rsp buffers are not always in locked memory, meaning a time-of-check, time-of-use issue can occur where we check that the value is valid, but then a race condition occurs where this memory is swapped out with a different, possibly out of range, value."], "published": "2018-04-18T14:29:05.403", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Qualcomm, Inc."], "productName": ["Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wear"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
