On releases prior to 3.0.3, an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either an open redirect attack or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack (depending on how AllTube is configured). The impact is mitigated by the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream` option is enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.) 3.0.3 contains a fix for this vulnerability."], "published": "2022-03-08T22:15:07.757", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Rudloff"], "productName": ["alltube"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/security/advisories/GHSA-75p7-527p-w8wp"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/3a4f09dda0a466662a4e52cde674749e0c668e8d", "https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/8913f27716400dabf4906a5ad690a5238f73496a", "https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/bc14b6e45c766c05757fb607ef8d444cbbfba71a"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["dailymotion", "download", "php", "video", "vimeo", "youtube", "youtube-dl"], "langs": {"PHP": 143108, "CSS": 12872, "Smarty": 12803, "Dockerfile": 613, "Shell": 130, "Procfile": 35}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/840125?v=4", "stargazers": 2980, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
