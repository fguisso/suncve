In HtmlSanitizer before version 5.0.372, there is a possible XSS bypass if style tag is allowed. If you have explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag. The problem has been fixed in version 5.0.372."], "published": "2021-01-04T19:15:14.970", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["mganss"], "productName": ["HtmlSanitizer"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-8j9v-h2vp-2hhv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/commit/a3a7602a44d4155d51ec0fbbedc2a49e9c7e2eb8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["html", "sanitizer", "xss"], "langs": {"C#": 259639}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/976344?v=4", "stargazers": 1607, "language": "C#"}}, "pocList": []}
