Access to the font glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of this data is controllable by the user, this can result in an out-of-bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process. On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-09-27T18:15:11.903", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["neutrinolabs"], "productName": ["xrdp"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/security/advisories/GHSA-2hjx-rm4f-r9hw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/commit/73acbe1f7957c65122b00de4d6f57a8d0d257c40"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c", "linux", "remote-desktop"], "langs": {"C": 4690888, "M4": 63052, "Shell": 47386, "C++": 41259, "Makefile": 30123, "ActionScript": 1532, "QMake": 821}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2615587?v=4", "stargazers": 6042, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
