In the WASMI Interpreter, an Out-of-bounds Buffer Write will arise if the host calls or resumes a Wasm function with more parameters than the default limit (128), as it will surpass the stack value. This doesnâ€™t affect calls from Wasm to Wasm, only from host to Wasm. This vulnerability was patched in version 0.31.1.\n"], "published": "2024-03-21T02:52:23.827", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["wasmi-labs"], "productName": ["wasmi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/security/advisories/GHSA-75jp-vq8x-h4cq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/commit/f7b3200e9f3dc9e2cbca966cb255c228453c792f"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["interpreter", "runtime", "rust", "vm", "wasm", "webassembly"], "langs": {"Rust": 3307663, "WebAssembly": 41492, "C": 33402, "CMake": 5725, "Shell": 705}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159383696?v=4", "stargazers": 1707, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
