Prior to version 0.3.0, ironic and ironic-inspector deployed within Baremetal Operator using the included `deploy.sh` store their `.htpasswd` files as ConfigMaps instead of Secrets. This causes the plain-text username and hashed password to be readable by anyone having a cluster-wide read-access to the management cluster, or access to the management cluster's Etcd storage. This issue is patched in baremetal-operator PR#1241, and is included in BMO release 0.3.0 onwards. As a workaround, users may modify the kustomizations and redeploy the BMO, or recreate the required ConfigMaps as Secrets per instructions in baremetal-operator PR#1241."], "published": "2023-04-26T19:15:09.140", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["metal3-io"], "productName": ["baremetal-operator"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-9wh7-397j-722m"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 1169619, "Shell": 65842, "Makefile": 13621, "Smarty": 13158, "Python": 7474, "Dockerfile": 1258}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49879880?v=4", "stargazers": 633, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
