Affected versions of FreeRDP are subject to a Null Pointer Dereference leading a crash in the RemoteFX (rfx) handling.  Inside the `rfx_process_message_tileset` function, the program allocates tiles using `rfx_allocate_tiles` for the number of numTiles. If the initialization process of tiles is not completed for various reasons, tiles will have a NULL pointer. Which may be accessed in further processing and would cause a program crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-08-31T20:15:08.280", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FreeRDP"], "productName": ["FreeRDP"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-q9x9-cqjc-rgwq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-q9x9-cqjc-rgwq", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["android", "c", "freerdp", "library", "rdp", "rdp-client", "rdp-connection", "remote-desktop", "sdl", "wayland-client", "x11"], "langs": {"C": 17781264, "C++": 716520, "CMake": 629392, "Objective-C": 540468, "Java": 373545, "HTML": 99135, "Shell": 56263, "Python": 48538, "Lua": 27393, "Roff": 26418, "Perl": 8044, "C#": 5756, "CSS": 5696, "Makefile": 3034, "Rich Text Format": 937}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663376?v=4", "stargazers": 11580, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
