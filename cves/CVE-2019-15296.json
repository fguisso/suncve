The faad_resetbits function in libfaad/bits.c is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability. The number of bits to be read is determined by ld->buffer_size - words*4, cast to uint32. If ld->buffer_size - words*4 is negative, a buffer overflow is later performed via getdword_n(&ld->start[words], ld->bytes_left)."], "published": "2019-08-21T07:15:10.830", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/knik0/faad2/commit/942c3e0aee748ea6fe97cb2c1aa5893225316174"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/knik0/faad2/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["aac", "audio", "decoder", "faad", "faad2", "m4a", "mp4"], "langs": {"C": 2511077, "CMake": 9034, "Starlark": 3101, "Roff": 2247}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1488271?v=4", "stargazers": 185, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
