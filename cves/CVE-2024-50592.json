In addition, instructions to execute \nbinaries to finalize the repair process are included. The executables are executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" after they are \ncopied over to the user writable installation folder (C:\\Elefant1). This\n means that a user can overwrite either \"PostESUUpdate.exe\" or \n\"Update_OpenJava.exe\" in the time frame after the copy and before the \nexecution of the final repair step. The overwritten executable is then executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"."], "published": "2024-11-08T13:15:03.670", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["HASOMED"], "productName": ["Elefant Software Updater"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
