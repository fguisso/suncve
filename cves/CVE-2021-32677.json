FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround."], "published": "2021-06-09T18:15:08.553", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["tiangolo"], "productName": ["fastapi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/security/advisories/GHSA-8h2j-cgx8-6xv7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/commit/fa7e3c996edf2d5482fff8f9d890ac2390dede4d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "async", "asyncio", "fastapi", "framework", "json", "json-schema", "openapi", "openapi3", "pydantic", "python", "python-types", "python3", "redoc", "rest", "starlette", "swagger", "swagger-ui", "uvicorn", "web"], "langs": {"Python": 3003210, "JavaScript": 1066, "Shell": 452, "HTML": 235, "CSS": 25}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156354296?v=4", "stargazers": 82922, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
