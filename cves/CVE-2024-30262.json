Prior to version 4.13.40, when a frontend member changes their password in the personal data or the password lost module, the corresponding remember-me tokens are not removed. If someone compromises an account and is able to get a remember-me token, changing the password would not be enough to reclaim control over the account. Version 4.13.40 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, disable \"Allow auto login\" in the login module.\n"], "published": "2024-04-09T17:16:02.850", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["contao"], "productName": ["contao"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/contao/contao/security/advisories/GHSA-r4r6-j2j3-7pp5"], "commits": ["https://github.com/contao/contao/commit/3032baa456f607169ffae82a8920354adb338fe9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/contao/contao/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cms", "contao", "monorepo", "php", "symfony"], "langs": {"PHP": 9070010, "Twig": 162859, "JavaScript": 160130, "CSS": 112526}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1206136?v=4", "stargazers": 367, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
