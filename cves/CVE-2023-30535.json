Users of the Snowflake JDBC driver were vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability. An attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. The vulnerability was patched on March 17, 2023 as part of Snowflake JDBC driver Version 3.13.29. All users should immediately upgrade the Snowflake JDBC driver to the latest version: 3.13.29."], "published": "2023-04-14T20:15:09.963", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["snowflakedb"], "productName": ["snowflake-jdbc"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-4g3j-c4wg-6j7x"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["database", "java", "jdbc", "sql"], "langs": {"Java": 4899245, "Shell": 24671, "Batchfile": 5703, "Python": 4357, "Lua": 3489, "Standard ML": 833}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6453780?v=4", "stargazers": 185, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
