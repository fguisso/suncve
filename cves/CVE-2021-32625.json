An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS command. On 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB)."], "published": "2021-06-02T20:15:07.187", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["redis"], "productName": ["redis"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-46cp-x4x9-6pfq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/redis/redis/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cache", "database", "key-value", "message-broker", "nosql", "redis"], "langs": {"C": 7375634, "Tcl": 2458884, "Python": 149631, "Makefile": 28225, "Shell": 23638, "Ruby": 23260, "C++": 5987, "Smarty": 1047, "JavaScript": 953}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529926?v=4", "stargazers": 68587, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
