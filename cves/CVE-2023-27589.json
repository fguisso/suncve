Starting with RELEASE.2020-12-23T02-24-12Z and prior to RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z, a user with `consoleAdmin` permissions can potentially create a user that matches the root credential `accessKey`. Once this user is created successfully, the root credential ceases to work appropriately. The issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z. There are ways to work around this via adding higher privileges to the disabled root user via `mc admin policy set`."], "published": "2023-03-14T19:15:10.547", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["minio"], "productName": ["minio"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-9wfv-wmf7-6753"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/minio/minio/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["amazon-s3", "cloud", "cloudnative", "cloudstorage", "go", "k8s", "kubernetes", "multi-cloud", "multi-cloud-kubernetes", "objectstorage", "s3", "storage"], "langs": {"Go": 8721848, "Shell": 72041, "Makefile": 11677, "Mustache": 6628, "Smarty": 872, "Dockerfile": 229}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/695951?v=4", "stargazers": 51341, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
