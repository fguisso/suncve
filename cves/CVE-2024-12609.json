This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Student-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."], "published": "2025-03-07T09:15:14.860", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["dasinfomedia"], "productName": ["School Management System for Wordpress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
