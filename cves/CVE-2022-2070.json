Because of that, an attacker could create a socket and connect with a remote IP:port by opening a shell and getting full access to the system. The exploit affects daemons dbmng and logsrv that are running on ports 8000 and 8001 by default."], "published": "2022-09-23T16:15:10.653", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Grandstream"], "productName": ["Grandstream GSD3710"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
