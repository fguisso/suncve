In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0."], "published": "2021-04-06T20:15:13.490", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["syncthing"], "productName": ["syncthing"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/security/advisories/GHSA-x462-89pf-6r5h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/commit/fb4fdaf4c0a79c22cad000c42ac1394e3ccb6a97"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["go", "p2p", "peer-to-peer", "synchronization"], "langs": {"Go": 2974383, "HTML": 245881, "JavaScript": 193044, "TypeScript": 94547, "Shell": 61862, "CSS": 25578, "SCSS": 8041, "Dockerfile": 1746, "Ruby": 723, "PowerShell": 264, "Batchfile": 124}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4", "stargazers": 69178, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
