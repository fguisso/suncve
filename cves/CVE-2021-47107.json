NFSD has never sanity-\nchecked the READDIR count argument, but the old entry encoders\nmanaged the problem correctly.\n\nWith the commits below, entry encoding changed, exposing the\nunderflow to the pointer arithmetic in xdr_reserve_space().\n\nModern NFS clients attempt to retrieve as much data as possible\nfor each READDIR request. Also, we have no unit tests that\nexercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of @count\nvalues. Thus this case was missed during testing."], "published": "2024-03-04T19:15:18.793", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
