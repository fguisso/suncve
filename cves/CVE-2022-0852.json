The specific impact varies upon the privileges of the Red Hat account in question, but it could affect the integrity, availability, and/or data confidentiality of other systems that are administered by that account. This occurs regardless of how the password is supplied to convert2rhel."], "published": "2022-08-29T15:15:10.027", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["convert2rhel"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/commit/8d72fb030ed31116fdb256b327d299337b000af4"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["almalinux", "centos", "conversion", "oracle-linux", "python", "rhel", "rockylinux"], "langs": {"Python": 1808914, "Dockerfile": 5105, "Makefile": 4821, "Shell": 2683, "C": 478}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44870667?v=4", "stargazers": 108, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
