Prior to version 1.18.0, SHIRASAGI is vulnerable to a Post-Unicode normalization issue. This happens when a logical validation or a security check is performed before a Unicode normalization. The Unicode character equivalent of a character would resurface after the normalization. The fix is initially performing the Unicode normalization and then strip for all whitespaces and then checking for a blank string. This issue has been fixed in version 1.18.0.\n"], "published": "2023-09-15T21:15:11.503", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["shirasagi"], "productName": ["shirasagi"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/shirasagi/shirasagi/security/advisories/GHSA-xr45-c2jv-2v9r"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/shirasagi/shirasagi/security/advisories/GHSA-xr45-c2jv-2v9r", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/shirasagi/shirasagi/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 16941961, "JavaScript": 16307404, "HTML": 4362240, "Fluent": 1483580, "CSS": 1110692, "SCSS": 843616, "Shell": 27583, "Dockerfile": 809, "templ": 144}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7464959?v=4", "stargazers": 111, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
