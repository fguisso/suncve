In affected versions of Pterodactyl a malicious user can trigger a user logout if a signed in user visits a malicious website that makes a request to the Panel's sign-out endpoint. This requires a targeted attack against a specific Panel instance, and serves only to sign a user out. **No user details are leaked, nor is any user data affected, this is simply an annoyance at worst.** This is fixed in version 1.6.3."], "published": "2021-10-25T17:15:09.380", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pterodactyl"], "productName": ["panel"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-m49f-hcxp-6hm6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/45999ba4ee1b2dcb12b4a2fa2cedfb6b5d66fac2"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["docker", "free", "games", "golang", "laravel", "management-system", "mit", "opensource", "php", "react", "tailwindcss", "typescript"], "langs": {"PHP": 1658615, "TypeScript": 558694, "Blade": 313257, "CSS": 33788, "JavaScript": 28750, "Nix": 3968, "Dockerfile": 2022}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16179146?v=4", "stargazers": 7386, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
