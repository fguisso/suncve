In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8."], "published": "2023-02-07T21:15:09.850", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pyca"], "productName": ["cryptography"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/security/advisories/GHSA-w7pp-m8wf-vj6r"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cryptography", "python"], "langs": {"Python": 2290119, "Rust": 859424, "Shell": 1558}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5615737?v=4", "stargazers": 6974, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
