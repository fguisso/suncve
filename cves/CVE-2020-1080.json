An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain elevated privileges on a target operating system.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run.  However, this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one or more vulnerabilities (e.g. a remote code execution vulnerability and another elevation of privilege) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows Hyper-V handles objects in memory.</p>\n"], "published": "2020-10-16T23:15:17.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Windows 10 Version 1803", "Windows 10 Version 1809", "Windows Server 2019", "Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1909", "Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems", "Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation)", "Windows 10 Version 2004", "Windows Server version 2004"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
