There are a number of CKAN plugins, including XLoader, DataPusher, Resource proxy and ckanext-archiver, that work by downloading the contents of local or remote files in order to perform some actions with their contents (e.g. pushing to the DataStore, streaming contents or saving a local copy). All of them use the resource URL, and there are currently no checks to limit what URLs can be requested. This means that a malicious (or unaware) user can create a resource with a URL pointing to a place where they should not have access in order for one of the previous tools to retrieve it (known as a Server Side Request Forgery). Users wanting to protect against these kinds of attacks can use one or a combination of the following approaches: (1) Use a separate HTTP proxy like Squid that can be used to allow / disallow IPs, domains etc as needed, and make CKAN extensions aware of this setting via the ckan.download_proxy config option. (2) Implement custom firewall rules to prevent access to restricted resources. (3) Use custom validators on the resource url field to block/allow certain domains or IPs. All latest versions of the plugins listed above support the ckan.download_proxy settings. Support for this setting in the Resource Proxy plugin was included in CKAN 2.10.5 and 2.11.0."], "published": "2024-08-21T15:15:09.190", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ckan"], "productName": ["ckan"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-g9ph-j5vj-f8wm"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "catalog", "ckan", "ckanext", "data", "digitalpublicgoods", "dpg", "open-data", "python", "sdg16"], "langs": {"Python": 4167677, "CSS": 1354678, "HTML": 831894, "JavaScript": 590575, "SCSS": 301038, "Shell": 7874, "Gherkin": 4881, "PLpgSQL": 4227, "Mako": 4140, "Dockerfile": 1045, "Smarty": 516}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630326?v=4", "stargazers": 4654, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
