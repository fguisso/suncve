In versions up to and including 1.1.1 the `org.conroller.js` code would erroneously log user secrets. This has been resolved in commit `46d98f2b` and should be available in subsequent versions of the software. Users of the software are advised to manually apply the `46d98f2b` commit or to update when a new version becomes available. As a workaround users should inspect their logs and remove logged secrets as appropriate."], "published": "2022-04-21T18:15:08.767", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["CVEProject"], "productName": ["cve-services"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/security/advisories/GHSA-rhj9-qx37-7m2m"], "commits": ["https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/commit/46d98f2b1427fc6ba1c2bc443dc6688fd400f1f4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 884335, "Python": 173617, "Dockerfile": 1596, "Shell": 1492}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18195825?v=4", "stargazers": 171, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
