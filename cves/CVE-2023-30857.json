Prior to version `0.6.1`, there is a possible prototype pollution issue for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from the `@aedart/support` package. The likelihood of exploitation is questionable, given that a class's metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to a security impact. The issue has been patched in version `0.6.1`.\n"], "published": "2023-04-28T21:15:09.127", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["aedart"], "productName": ["ion"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/aedart/ion/security/advisories/GHSA-wwxh-74fx-33c6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/aedart/ion/commit/c3e2ee08710d4164d796ecb66ed291335dae9291"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/aedart/ion/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"JavaScript": 410841, "TypeScript": 401893, "Vue": 3217, "Shell": 1270}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1523223?v=4", "stargazers": 1, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
