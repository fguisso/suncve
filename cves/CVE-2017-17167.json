The software uses risky cryptographic algorithm in SSL. This is dangerous because a remote unauthenticated attacker could use well-known techniques to break the algorithm. Successful exploit could result in the exposure of sensitive information."], "published": "2018-03-09T17:29:00.643", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd."], "productName": ["DP300; TP3206; ViewPoint 9030"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
