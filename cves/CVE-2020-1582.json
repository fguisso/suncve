An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\nExploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Access. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Access handles objects in memory.\n"], "published": "2020-08-17T19:15:21.523", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Microsoft"], "productName": ["Microsoft Access 2013 Service Pack 1 (32-bit editions)", "Microsoft Access 2013 Service Pack 1 (64-bit editions)", "Microsoft Office 2019", "Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise", "Microsoft Access 2016 (32-bit edition)", "Microsoft Access 2016 (64-bit edition)", "Microsoft Access 2010 Service Pack 2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
