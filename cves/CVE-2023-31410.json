The attacker can exploit this weakness to eavesdrop on the communication between the EventCam App and the Client, and potentially manipulate the data being transmitted."], "published": "2023-06-19T15:15:09.173", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["SICK AG"], "productName": ["EventCam App"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
