Starting in version 0.16.0 and prior to version 0.18.0, an attacker may be able to remotely read arbitrary files without authentication due to a path traversal vulnerability. Users who exposed the Sunshine configuration web user interface outside of localhost may be affected, depending on firewall configuration. To exploit vulnerability, attacker could make an http/s request to the `node_modules` endpoint if user exposed Sunshine config web server to internet or attacker is on the LAN. Version 0.18.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may block access to Sunshine via firewall."], "published": "2024-04-05T15:15:08.060", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["LizardByte"], "productName": ["Sunshine"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-6rg7-7m3w-w5wc"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cpp", "docker", "flathub-pkg", "game-stream", "game-streaming", "game-streaming-server", "geforce-experience", "homebrew-pkg", "maintainer-wanted", "moonlight", "pacman-pkg", "python", "remote-desktop", "replicator-custom-issues", "replicator-release-notifications", "rtd", "winget-pkg"], "langs": {"C++": 1620851, "HTML": 91098, "CMake": 82508, "Vue": 70941, "Shell": 32321, "Objective-C++": 29713, "HLSL": 12658, "Dockerfile": 12604, "Objective-C": 12591, "Cuda": 10984, "JavaScript": 10542, "Batchfile": 9595, "C": 7219, "Python": 5943, "Ruby": 4639, "GLSL": 2375, "Rust": 1770, "CSS": 375}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84790584?v=4", "stargazers": 24150, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
