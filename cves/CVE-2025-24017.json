Versions up to and including 4.4.5 are vulnerable to any end-user crafting a DOM based XSS on all of YesWiki's pages which is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link. The vulnerability makes use of the search by tag feature. When a tag doesn't exist, the tag is reflected on the page and isn't properly sanitized on the server side which allows a malicious user to generate a link that will trigger an XSS on the client's side when clicked. This vulnerability allows any user to generate a malicious link that will trigger an account takeover when clicked, therefore allowing a user to steal other accounts, modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue."], "published": "2025-01-21T16:15:15.087", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["YesWiki"], "productName": ["yeswiki"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["collaborative", "french", "open-source-licensing", "php", "wiki"], "langs": {"PHP": 3456670, "JavaScript": 760732, "Twig": 312401, "CSS": 196851, "HTML": 149061, "Shell": 1920, "Makefile": 1516}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12066638?v=4", "stargazers": 113, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
