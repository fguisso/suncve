This issue occurs because the administrator owns the object due to the lack of an Access Control List (ACL) at the time of creation and later being recognized as the 'creator owner.' The retained significant rights of the delegated administrator may not be well understood, potentially leading to unintended privilege escalation or security risks."], "published": "2024-11-17T11:15:04.320", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9", "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4", "Red Hat Storage 3"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
