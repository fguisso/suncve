These vulnerabilities occur in the diagnostics CGI (/cgi-bin/diagnostics) component responsible for emailing out information about the state of the system. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'tsrDeleteRestartedFile' or 'currentTSREmailTo' variables before making a call to system(), allowing for remote command injection. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the nobody user account."], "published": "2017-02-22T05:59:00.167", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
