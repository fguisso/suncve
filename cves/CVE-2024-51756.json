Untrusted filesystem paths could bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special device filenames with superscript digits, and through them provide access peripheral devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped to those devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other device connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports. The bug is fixed in #371, which is published in cap-primitives 3.4.1, cap-std 3.4.1, and cap-async-std 3.4.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue. Affected Windows users are recommended to upgrade."], "published": "2024-11-05T22:15:21.817", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["bytecodealliance"], "productName": ["cap-std"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/security/advisories/GHSA-hxf5-99xg-86hw"], "commits": ["https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/commit/dcc3818039761331fbeacbb3a40c542b65b5ebf7"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["rust", "sandboxing", "security"], "langs": {"Rust": 1307050}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54038801?v=4", "stargazers": 682, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
