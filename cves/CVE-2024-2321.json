Due to improper authorization checks and token mapping, session cookies are not required for API access, potentially enabling unauthorized operations.\n\nExploitation requires an attacker to obtain a valid refresh token of an admin user. Since refresh tokens generally have a longer expiration time, this could lead to prolonged unauthorized access to API resources, impacting data confidentiality and integrity."], "published": "2025-02-27T05:15:13.797", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["WSO2"], "productName": ["WSO2 API Manager", "WSO2 Identity Server"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
