Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files. This could lead to a stack based buffer overflow while trying to copy to a buffer during font string handling. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process."], "published": "2021-01-12T21:15:17.387", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Siemens"], "productName": ["JT2Go", "Teamcenter Visualization"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
