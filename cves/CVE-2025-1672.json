This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."], "published": "2025-03-06T10:15:11.897", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ninjateam"], "productName": ["Notibar – Notification Bar for WordPress"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
