This then allows a malicious user to provide code that will execute when a user views the specific log on the \"view=log\" page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to store code within the logs that will be executed when loaded by a legitimate user. These actions will be performed with the permission of the victim. This could lead to data loss and/or further exploitation including account takeover. This issue has been addressed in versions `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable database logging."], "published": "2022-10-07T21:15:11.397", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["ZoneMinder"], "productName": ["zoneminder"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/security/advisories/GHSA-h6xp-cvwv-q433"], "commits": ["https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/commit/c0a4c05e84eea0f6ccf7169c014efe5422c9ba0d", "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/commit/d289eb48601a76e34feea3c1683955337b1fae59"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/security/advisories/GHSA-h6xp-cvwv-q433", "kw": ["payload:"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cctv", "distributed", "h264", "h265", "scalable", "video", "vms", "zmninja", "zoneminder"], "langs": {"PHP": 11940934, "Perl": 7516358, "JavaScript": 5457623, "C++": 1958296, "Objective-C": 593076, "CSS": 217130, "CMake": 140707, "Shell": 95213, "C": 79112, "HTML": 32532, "Makefile": 13217, "Mustache": 8392, "Python": 7935, "Assembly": 4220, "Batchfile": 2880, "Dockerfile": 1347}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4137646?v=4", "stargazers": 5406, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
