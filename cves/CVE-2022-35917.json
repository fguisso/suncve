When a Solana Pay transaction is located using a reference key, it may be checked to represent a transfer of the desired amount to the recipient, using the supplied `validateTransfer` function. An edge case regarding this mechanism could cause the validation logic to validate multiple transfers. This issue has been patched as of version `0.2.1`. Users of the Solana Pay SDK should upgrade to it. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-08-01T22:15:10.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["solana-labs"], "productName": ["solana-pay"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/security/advisories/GHSA-j47c-j42c-mwqq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/commit/ac6ce0d0a81137700874a8bf5a7caac3be999fad"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"TypeScript": 54834, "JavaScript": 209}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142632002?v=4", "stargazers": 1370, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
