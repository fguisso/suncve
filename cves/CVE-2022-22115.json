Since the Tag name is not being sanitized properly in the edit tag page, a low privileged attacker can store malicious scripts in the name of the Tag. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, and privileges escalation."], "published": "2022-01-10T16:15:09.993", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sismics"], "productName": ["docs"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": ["https://github.com/sismics/docs/commit/4951229576d6892dc58ab8c572e73639ca82d80c"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/sismics/docs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud", "dms", "docker", "document", "enterprise", "file-sharing", "java", "javascript", "ocr", "open-source", "self-hosting", "sharing", "workflow"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 1797985, "Java": 1368074, "HTML": 178130, "Less": 11500, "CSS": 4825, "Dockerfile": 2575, "Shell": 1509, "FreeMarker": 1490}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4084170?v=4", "stargazers": 2112, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
