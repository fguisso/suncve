Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected versions for user authentication, in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism, are vulnerable to session fixation attacks from network and same-site attackers. fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"], "published": "2023-04-21T23:15:20.197", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["fastify"], "productName": ["fastify-passport"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/security/advisories/GHSA-4m3m-ppvx-xgw9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/commit/43c82c321db58ea3e375dd475de60befbfcf2a11"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["authentication", "fastify", "fastify-plugin", "passport"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 128835, "JavaScript": 344}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24939410?v=4", "stargazers": 274, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
