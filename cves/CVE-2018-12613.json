The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the \"$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true\" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the \"$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0\" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication)."], "published": "2018-06-21T20:29:00.327", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/0x00-0x00/CVE-2018-12613", "https://github.com/ivanitlearning/CVE-2018-12613", "https://github.com/eastmountyxz/CVE-2018-12613-phpMyAdmin", "https://github.com/0x00-0x00/CVE-2018-12613", "https://github.com/ivanitlearning/CVE-2018-12613", "https://github.com/eastmountyxz/CVE-2018-12613-phpMyAdmin"]}
