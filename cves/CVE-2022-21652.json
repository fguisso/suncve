In affected versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue."], "published": "2022-01-05T20:15:08.117", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["shopware"], "productName": ["shopware"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-p523-jrph-qjc6"], "commits": ["https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/47ebd126a94f4b019b6fde64c0df3d18d74ef7d0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api-first-cms", "apifirst", "digital-commerce", "ecommerce", "ecommerce-platform", "experience-commerce", "experience-manager", "hacktoberfest", "headless-cms", "magento", "online-shop", "online-store", "php", "prestashop", "shop", "shopping-cart", "shopware", "storefront", "symfony", "vuejs"], "langs": {"PHP": 33148885, "JavaScript": 12681381, "Twig": 4772824, "TypeScript": 2041509, "SCSS": 1023689, "CSS": 135217, "Vue": 32138, "Shell": 30355, "HTML": 27250, "Nix": 4870, "Groovy": 3900, "Smarty": 1174}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/612628?v=4", "stargazers": 2998, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
