In versions prior to 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0, a high-privileged user could create a Package referencing an arbitrarily large image containing that Crossplane would then parse, possibly resulting in exhausting all the available memory and therefore in the container being OOMKilled. The impact is limited due to the high privileges required to be able to create the Package and the eventually consistency nature of controller. This issue is fixed in versions 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0."], "published": "2023-07-27T16:15:10.157", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["crossplane"], "productName": ["crossplane"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/security/advisories/GHSA-68p4-95xf-7gx8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloud-computing", "cloud-management", "cloud-native", "cncf", "containers", "control-plane", "infrastructure", "infrastructure-as-code", "kubernetes", "multicloud", "serverless"], "langs": {"Go": 3285418, "Earthly": 19807, "Shell": 8262, "Mustache": 1219}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45158470?v=4", "stargazers": 10106, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
