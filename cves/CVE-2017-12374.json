The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations on bounce messages). If successfully exploited, the ClamAV software could allow a variable pointing to the mail body which could cause a used after being free (use-after-free) instance which may lead to a disruption of services on an affected device to include a denial of service condition."], "published": "2018-01-26T20:29:00.283", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
