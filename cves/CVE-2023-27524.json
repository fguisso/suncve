Your SECRET_KEY is used to securely sign all session cookies and encrypting sensitive information on the database.\nAdd a strong SECRET_KEY to your `superset_config.py` file like:\n\nSECRET_KEY = <YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY>\n\nAlternatively you can set it with `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.\n"], "published": "2023-04-24T16:15:07.843", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Superset"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/Okaytc/Superset_auth_bypass_check", "https://github.com/ZZ-SOCMAP/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/MaanVader/CVE-2023-27524-POC", "https://github.com/ThatNotEasy/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/TardC/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/necroteddy/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/jakabakos/CVE-2023-27524-Apache-Superset-Auth-Bypass-and-RCE", "https://github.com/CN016/Apache-Superset-SECRET_KEY-CVE-2023-27524-", "https://github.com/h1n4mx0/Research-CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/karthi-the-hacker/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/Cappricio-Securities/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/Okaytc/Superset_auth_bypass_check", "https://github.com/ZZ-SOCMAP/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/MaanVader/CVE-2023-27524-POC", "https://github.com/ThatNotEasy/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/TardC/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/necroteddy/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/jakabakos/CVE-2023-27524-Apache-Superset-Auth-Bypass-and-RCE", "https://github.com/CN016/Apache-Superset-SECRET_KEY-CVE-2023-27524-", "https://github.com/h1n4mx0/Research-CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/karthi-the-hacker/CVE-2023-27524", "https://github.com/Cappricio-Securities/CVE-2023-27524"]}
