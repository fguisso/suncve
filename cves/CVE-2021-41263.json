In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture."], "published": "2021-11-15T20:15:20.037", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["discourse"], "productName": ["rails_multisite"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/discourse/rails_multisite/security/advisories/GHSA-844m-cpr9-jcmh"], "commits": ["https://github.com/discourse/rails_multisite/commit/c6785cdb5c9277dd2c5ac8d55180dd1ece440ed0"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/discourse/rails_multisite/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["rubygem"], "langs": {"Ruby": 30856}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220138?v=4", "stargazers": 268, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
