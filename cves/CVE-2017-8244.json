Buffer overflow is possible on race conditions. \"buffer->curr\" itself could also be overwritten, which means that it may point to anywhere of kernel memory (for write)."], "published": "2017-05-12T20:29:00.313", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Qualcomm, Inc."], "productName": ["Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
