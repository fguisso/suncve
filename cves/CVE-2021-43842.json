Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258."], "published": "2021-12-20T23:15:29.300", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Requarks"], "productName": ["wiki"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-3qv4-gp35-rgh7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cross-platform", "documentation", "git", "markdown", "nodejs", "open-source", "wiki"], "langs": {"Vue": 885886, "JavaScript": 785330, "SCSS": 93552, "HTML": 37190, "Shell": 31046, "Pug": 14489, "Go": 3549, "CSS": 3199, "Dockerfile": 3028, "Mustache": 2944}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16729233?v=4", "stargazers": 25981, "language": "Vue"}}, "pocList": []}
