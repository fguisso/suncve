This would cause the users to \nretain their previous permissions in Rancher, even if they change groups\n on Azure AD, for example, to a lower privileged group, or are removed \nfrom a group, thus retaining their access to Rancher instead of losing \nit.\nThis issue affects Rancher: from >= 2.6.7 before < 2.6.13, from >= 2.7.0 before < 2.7.4."], "published": "2023-06-01T13:15:10.553", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["SUSE"], "productName": ["Rancher"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-vf6j-6739-78m8"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rancher/rancher/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cattle", "containers", "docker", "kubernetes", "orchestration", "rancher"], "langs": {"Go": 12468555, "Python": 1455203, "Groovy": 295608, "Shell": 184436, "HCL": 39777, "PowerShell": 38206, "Dockerfile": 36450, "Jinja": 30303, "Mustache": 2354, "JavaScript": 609, "Makefile": 542, "Batchfile": 395}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9343010?v=4", "stargazers": 23995, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
