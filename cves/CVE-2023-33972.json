A workaround to address this issue is to disable CREATE privileges on a keyspace, and create new tables on behalf of other users."], "published": "2023-09-27T19:15:11.497", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["scylladb"], "productName": ["scylladb"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/security/advisories/GHSA-ww5v-p45p-3vhq"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["c-plus-plus", "cassandra", "cpp", "database", "nosql", "scylla", "seastar"], "langs": {"C++": 23224728, "Python": 6720025, "CMake": 115933, "GAP": 111441, "Shell": 103434, "Rust": 29693, "Lua": 19228, "Assembly": 14822, "Nix": 6351, "C": 3191, "Ragel": 2971, "Dockerfile": 602, "Hack": 252}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14364730?v=4", "stargazers": 14291, "language": "C++"}}, "pocList": []}
