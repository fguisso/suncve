A SSRF vulnerability exists starting in version 3.2.0, bypassing existing controls on the software. This can allow a user to request internal services for a full read SSRF, returning any data from the internal network. The application is using a whitelist, but the whitelist can be bypassed. The bypass will trick the application that the first host is a whitelisted address, but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a credential to the host geoserver on port 8080, this will return the data to that host on the response. Version 4.1.3.post1 is the first available version that contains a patch."], "published": "2023-09-15T21:15:11.780", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["GeoNode"], "productName": ["geonode"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/security/advisories/GHSA-pxg5-h34r-7q8p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/commit/79ac6e70419c2e0261548bed91c159b54ff35b8d"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["django", "gis", "python", "sdi", "spatial-data-infrastructure"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 8573163, "Python": 5667059, "HTML": 573876, "CSS": 547762, "XSLT": 67411, "Less": 62479, "Shell": 21517, "SCSS": 3477, "Scheme": 3155, "Dockerfile": 2891, "Makefile": 1976, "Gherkin": 529}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132843?v=4", "stargazers": 1509, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
