This spends a couple of hundred megabytes of memory in the process. Further connections will become impossible, likely because no more threads can be spawned by the D-Bus service.\n\n"], "published": "2024-05-08T02:15:09.503", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Fedora"], "productName": ["dnf5daemon-server"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
