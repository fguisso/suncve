Domains configured with interactsh server prior to version 1.0.0 were vulnerable to subdomain takeover for a specific subdomain, i.e `app.` Interactsh server used to create cname entries for `app` pointing to `projectdiscovery.github.io` as default, which intended to used for hosting interactsh web client using GitHub pages. This is a security issue with a self-hosted interactsh server in which the user may not have configured a web client but still have a CNAME entry pointing to GitHub pages, making them vulnerable to subdomain takeover. This allows a threat actor to host / run arbitrary client side code (cross-site scripting) in a user's browser when browsing the vulnerable subdomain. Version 1.0.0 fixes this issue by making CNAME optional, rather than default."], "published": "2023-06-28T22:15:09.503", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["projectdiscovery"], "productName": ["interactsh"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/security/advisories/GHSA-m36x-mgfh-8g78"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["appsec", "bugbounty", "dns", "golang", "http", "ldap", "oast", "oob", "security", "smtp"], "langs": {"Go": 169598, "Jinja": 7450, "Python": 557, "Dockerfile": 501}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50994705?v=4", "stargazers": 3676, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
