This is due to the plugin improperly validating the number of characters supplied during an annotation despite there being a setting to limit the number characters input. This means that unauthenticated attackers can bypass the length restrictions and input more characters than allowed via the settings."], "published": "2022-12-13T21:15:11.870", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["demonisblack"], "productName": ["demon image annotation"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
