In versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.6 a polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm's autolink extension may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. Users may verify the patch by running `python3 -c 'print(\"![l\"* 100000 + \"\\n\")' | ./cmark-gfm -e autolink`, which will resource exhaust on unpatched cmark-gfm but render correctly on patched cmark-gfm. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the use of the autolink extension."], "published": "2022-09-15T18:15:12.260", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["github"], "productName": ["cmark-gfm"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-cgh3-p57x-9q7q"], "commits": ["https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/commit/9d57d8a23142b316282bdfc954cb0ecda40a8655"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"C": 768727, "C++": 201370, "Python": 50409, "CMake": 22945, "XSLT": 11938, "Racket": 8625, "Makefile": 7169, "Shell": 899, "Dockerfile": 820, "Perl": 525, "Ruby": 316, "Batchfile": 294, "JavaScript": 102}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4", "stargazers": 953, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
