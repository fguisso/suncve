This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory."], "published": "2021-03-03T18:15:14.893", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["https://github.com/nodejs/node"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
