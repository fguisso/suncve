In version 0.5.1 and prior, converting a GDB registers profile file into a Rizin register profile can result in a stack-based buffer overflow when the `name`, `type`, or `groups` fields have longer values than expected. Users opening untrusted GDB registers files (e.g. with the `drpg` or `arpg` commands) are affected by this flaw. Commit d6196703d89c84467b600ba2692534579dc25ed4 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, review the GDB register profiles before loading them with `drpg`/`arpg` commands."], "published": "2023-03-14T21:15:10.763", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rizinorg"], "productName": ["rizin"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/security/advisories/GHSA-rqcp-m8m2-jcqf"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/d6196703d89c84467b600ba2692534579dc25ed4"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["debugging", "exploitation", "program-analysis", "reverse-engineering", "security"], "langs": {"C": 31071894, "C++": 401500, "Meson": 198209, "Python": 65585, "Roff": 41855, "JavaScript": 14832, "Shell": 6013, "CMake": 5683, "Pawn": 5132, "Perl": 4737, "Rust": 3262, "Dockerfile": 2896, "Assembly": 1148, "R": 539, "Gnuplot": 431}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72097027?v=4", "stargazers": 2862, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
