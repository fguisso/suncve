A third-party component used in the pump does not verify input buffer size prior to copying, leading to a buffer overflow, allowing remote code execution on the target device. The pump receives the potentially malicious input infrequently and under certain conditions, increasing the difficulty of exploitation."], "published": "2018-02-15T10:29:00.227", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Smiths Medical Medfusion 4000 Wireless Syringe Infusion Pump"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
