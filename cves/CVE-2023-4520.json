This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, and makes it possible to update the user metas arbitrarily, but the meta value can only be a string."], "published": "2023-08-25T03:15:09.223", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["foliovision"], "productName": ["FV Flowplayer Video Player"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
