The specific pathname ../configuration.php should be base64 encoded for a valid attack. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because only files under the media-manager path can be downloaded, and the documentation indicates that sensitive information does not belong there. Nonetheless, 2.8.1 has additional blocking of .php downloads."], "published": "2018-02-28T07:29:00.353", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
