Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet."], "published": "2022-10-31T19:15:10.593", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["conduit-rust"], "productName": ["conduit-hyper"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/conduit-rust/conduit-hyper/security/advisories/GHSA-9398-5ghf-7pr6"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/conduit-rust/conduit-hyper/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 19878}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8010725?v=4", "stargazers": 4, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
