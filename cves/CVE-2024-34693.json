If both the MariaDB server (off by default) and the local mysql client on the web server are set to allow for local infile, it's possible for the attacker to execute a specific MySQL/MariaDB SQL command that is able to read files from the server and insert their content on a MariaDB database table.This issue affects Apache Superset: before 3.1.3 and version 4.0.0\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.1 or 3.1.3, which fixes the issue.\n\n"], "published": "2024-06-20T09:15:11.683", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Superset"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/mbadanoiu/CVE-2024-34693", "https://github.com/Mr-r00t11/CVE-2024-34693", "https://github.com/mbadanoiu/CVE-2024-34693", "https://github.com/Mr-r00t11/CVE-2024-34693"]}
