(This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing permission to create custom blocks on the site, which is typically an administrative permission.)"], "published": "2019-08-08T02:15:11.023", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
