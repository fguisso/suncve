An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view HTTP proxy server admin credentials in clear text that are configured on Nexus Dashboard to reach an external network.\r\nNote: Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information."], "published": "2024-10-02T17:15:17.350", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Data Center Network Manager", "Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
