The revocation schema that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, allowing a malicious holder of a revoked credential to generate a valid Non-Revocation Proof for that credential as part of an AnonCreds presentation. A verifier may verify a credential from a holder as being \"not revoked\" when in fact, the holder's credential has been revoked. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected."], "published": "2024-01-16T22:15:45.810", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["hyperledger-archives"], "productName": ["ursa"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa/security/advisories/GHSA-r78f-4q2q-hvv4"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 2610395, "Python": 9455, "C": 9185, "Sage": 6242, "Dockerfile": 4367, "Perl": 3884, "Shell": 260, "Batchfile": 258}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20729145?v=4", "stargazers": 326, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
