This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This missing authorization aspect of this was patched in 2.4.1, while the Cross-Site Scripting was fully patched in 2.4.4."], "published": "2024-12-06T09:15:08.877", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sasonikolov"], "productName": ["Event Tickets with Ticket Scanner"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
